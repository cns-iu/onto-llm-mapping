UBERON_0000946,"A membranous fold of the heart, also known as cardiac valve, is a critical component of the cardiovascular system that separates the left atrium and right ventricle from the pulmonary artery and aorta, respectively. This complex structure allows for the directed flow of blood in one direction while preventing backflow. The cardiac valve is composed of two main components: the flaps (leaflets) and the annulus. The leaflets are thin-walled, fibrous structures that cover the base of the valve flaps, which are attached to the heart's valves using ligaments. These flaps are typically 2-5 mm in thickness and exhibit variable resistance to flow. The cardiac valve is a type of atrioventricular (AV) valve, which enables communication between the atria and ventricles while maintaining blood pressure gradients across the valve. The structure is designed to withstand high pressures and velocities, making it an essential component of the heart's pumping function. A unique feature of the cardiac valve is its ability to modulate flow in response to changing demands. During systole (contraction), the leaflets are closed, preventing backflow and ensuring blood flows from the atria into the ventricles. Conversely, during diastole (relaxation), the leaflets become slightly rounded or fluffed, reducing resistance and allowing for increased flow. The cardiac valve also plays a crucial role in regulating the timing of the heart's pumping function. The mitral valve, located between the left atrium and left ventricle, is responsible for preventing backflow into the atria during diastole, while the tricuspid valve regulates blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The cardiac valve has been extensively studied using advanced imaging techniques such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These methods have revealed intricate details of the valve's structure and function,"
UBERON_0000948,"The vertebrate heart is a complex, myogenic muscular organ that functions as the primary circulatory organ. It is composed of chambers of cardiac muscle tissue, which are organized into distinct structures such as atria and ventricles. In its normal state, the heart is in a contracted, spheric shape, with the septa separating the chambers and preventing their immediate contraction. This is achieved through the coordinated contraction of the myocytes surrounding each chamber, leading to a reduction in cavity size and an increase in wall tension. This mechanism allows for efficient blood flow through the heart. The atria are specialized chambers that receive deoxygenated blood from the body and transport it to the ventricles. The atrioventricular (AV) valves, which control blood flow between the atria and ventricles, function as semipermeable membranes that prevent backflow into the atria. The AV valves are composed of three layers: an innermost endothelial layer, a middle chordal layer, and an outer elastic lamina. The ventricles, on the other hand, receive blood from the AV valves and pump it out to the body. Each ventricle is further divided into four chambers: the left and right atria, and two ventricular chambers (left and right ventricles). The left ventricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the rest of the body, while the right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the heart and pumps it out to the lungs. The ventricles are composed of myocardium, a layer of cardiac muscle tissue that contracts to pump blood through the chambers. The epicardium, the outermost layer of the ventricular wall, is composed of fibrous connective tissue that provides structural support. In addition to its muscular contraction mechanism, the heart also has a complex system of valves and vessels that prevent back"
UBERON_0001621,"The coronary artery, also known as the coronary arterial tree, is a complex network of blood vessels that supply the myocardium with oxygenated blood. The term ""coronary"" specifically refers to this vascular structure. Anatomically, the coronary arteries arise from the aortic arch and descend along the anterior interventricular groove to supply the right ventricle and left atrium. There are two main branches: the anterior descending artery (LAD) and the posterior descending artery (PDA). The LAD supplies approximately 50% of the heart's blood flow, while the PDA accounts for the remaining 50%. The LAD originates from the left coronary sinus and ascends through the left ventricle to reach the right ventricle. It divides into two main branches: the anterior ascending coronary artery (AACA) and the posterior descending artery (PDA). The AACA supplies blood to the anterolateral wall of the heart, while the PDA provides oxygenated blood to the inferior aspect of the heart. These branches then further divide into smaller sub-arteries that supply individual myocardial segments. In addition to these main coronary arteries, there are several other coronary branches and collateral pathways that can provide alternative routes for blood flow in case of acute occlusion or thrombosis. These include the left circumflex artery (LCx), the right coronary sinus branch, and various small interventricular branches. The coronary arterial tree is an intricate network that requires precise regulation to maintain optimal myocardial function. Any disruption in this delicate balance can lead to ischemic heart disease, resulting in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or even cardiac death. Understanding the complexities of the coronary artery anatomy and physiology is essential for developing effective treatments for cardiovascular diseases, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). By recognizing the intricate relationships"
UBERON_0001625,"The right coronary artery (RCA) is a major branch of the subclavian artery that supplies blood to the myocardium of the right ventricle, atria, andicus muscles of the heart. It is formed by the fusion of two terminal branches: the anterior descending artery (ADA) and the diagonal artery. Embryologically, the RCA arises from the left coronary sinus and the marginal trunk, which then merge to form the ADA. The diagonal artery, in turn, arises from the pulmonary trunk and supplies blood to the right atrium and right ventricle. As described by the Oxford Handbook of Medical Illustration, ""The RCA is a critical landmark for cardiac imaging, particularly for identifying coronary artery disease."" Its location along the right side of the heart makes it vulnerable to conditions such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. In terms of its function, the RCA is responsible for supplying blood to the majority of the right ventricular and atrial myocardium. It also provides collateral circulation to the inferior wall of the left ventricle through the posterior descending artery (PDA), which arises from the left coronary artery. The RCA's anatomy can be complex, with multiple territories of supply to the different parts of the heart. For example, the anterior two-thirds of the RCA is responsible for supplying blood to the anterior two-thirds of the right ventricle and the anterolateral walls of the left atrium. The RCA has several variants, including a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio (i.e., one artery supplying half the territory) and a 3:5 or 4:6 ratio (i.e., three arteries or four). These variations can influence surgical approaches and risk assessment for coronary artery disease. In summary, the right coronary artery is a vital structure that supplies blood to the majority of the right ventricular and"
UBERON_0001626,"The left coronary artery, also known as LCA or LCx, is a major branch of the cardiac circulation that originates from the left ventricle. It arises from the left ventricular apex and descends along the anterior surface of the heart to supply the myocardium of the left ventricle. Anatomically, the left coronary artery bifurcates into two main branches: the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the right coronary artery (RCA). The LAD typically supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle, while the RCA primarily serves the posterior wall. The LAD arises from the left coronary sinus, a venous structure that collects deoxygenated blood from the myocardium. It then passes between the anterior and lateral interventricular septa to reach its branch point with the RCA. The right coronary artery originates from the coronary sinus and ascends along the right ventricle to supply the posterior wall of the left ventricle, as well as parts of the apex and septum. It then bifurcates into the LCA and the marginal branches, which further divide to supply the myocardium of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. The left coronary artery plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function by ensuring adequate blood flow to the heart muscle. Its unique anatomy allows it to supply both anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle, ensuring that the heart can pump efficiently and maintain perfusion of vital organs. In addition to its primary function, the LCA is also susceptible to ischemia due to coronary artery disease, which can lead to myocardial infarction. The presence of coronary artery disease on imaging studies such as echocardiography or angiography highlights the importance of monitoring this vessel for potential stenosis or thrombosis. Understanding the anatomy and function of the left coronary artery is essential for assessing cardiac health and identifying"
UBERON_0002078,"The right cardiac atrium, also known as the cardiac right atrium or heart right atrium, is a crucial component of the cardiovascular system. Located on the right side of the heart, it plays a vital role in the circulation of deoxygenated blood. Blood from the superior and inferior vena cava, as well as the coronary sinus, enters the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. This venous blood then flows into the right atrium via the foramen ovale, which is a gap in the septum between the two atria. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from both vena cavae and the coronary sinus, marking the beginning of the right side's contribution to the systemic circulation. The right atrium's primary function is to receive deoxygenated blood from the body, which then flows into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve is a complex mechanism that ensures blood flow in one direction, preventing backflow and maintaining efficient circulation. Once pumped into the right ventricle, oxygen-rich blood is then pumped to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. The right atrium's unique structure and function enable it to efficiently collect deoxygenated blood from the body and transport it to the lungs for oxygenation. The atrial wall of the right atrium is composed of four chambers: the superior vena cava chamber, the inferior vena cava chamber, the coronary sinus chamber, and the upper part of the right atrium's posterior chamber. The tricuspid valve ensures that blood flows from the venous system to the arterial system in a precise manner. The concept of cardiac atria is often discussed in conjunction with ventricles, but the right atrium has distinct characteristics compared to its left counterpart. While both play crucial roles in circulation, their anatomical and physiological differences underscore their"
UBERON_0002079,"The left cardiac atrium, also known as the cardiac left atrium (CLA), is a critical structure in the heart that plays a vital role in the circulation of blood throughout the body. It is situated on the left side of the heart and receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins via the mitral valve. Located within the left atrium, the superior vena cava empties its blood into this chamber, which then drains back to the left ventricle through the tricuspid valve. This process is a crucial step in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the body's tissues. The CLA also receives deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins via the pulmonary venous valves into the atrium, where it is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve. This valvular mechanism facilitates the efficient flow of blood between the atria and ventricles. In addition to its role in blood circulation, the CLA also serves as a reservoir for oxygenated blood before its delivery to the body's tissues. The left atrium has a unique structure that allows it to store and release blood at will, enabling it to adjust to changes in systemic demand. The CLA is composed of two main chambers: the superior and inferior vena cava's into which the blood enters; and the left atrioventricular valve separating the atrium from the ventricle. The mitral valve, situated between these structures, regulates the flow of blood by controlling the direction of oxygenated blood towards the left ventricle. Furthermore, the CLA is innervated by the vagus nerve, which plays a crucial role in regulating heart rate and contractility through the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine. This neural control allows for adjustments to be made in cardiac function based on the body's needs. In summary, the left cardiac"
UBERON_0002080,"The cardiac right ventricle is a crucial component of the heart, specifically situated on the right side of the atrioventricular (AV) valves that separate the left and right atria from the right ventricle. As the primary pump organ for blood circulation from the left ventricle to the rest of the body, it plays a vital role in maintaining systemic vascular tone. Physiologically, the cardiac right ventricle is composed of two ventricular walls, with the septum dividing them into anterior and posterior portions. The anterior wall is thinner than the posterior wall, forming a narrow chamber that connects the right atrium to the pulmonary trunk via the tricuspid valve. This allows for efficient blood flow from the right atrium to the lungs. In terms of its functional structure, the cardiac right ventricle has several distinct regions, including the infundibulum (a funnel-shaped structure leading to the pulmonary artery), the sinus venarum (the smooth-walled chamber between the sinuses and the infundibulum), and the ostium pulmonale (the opening into the main pulmonary artery). The right ventricular outflow tract is responsible for conducting blood through the tricuspid valve into the pulmonary artery. The cardiac right ventricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary circulation, which then flows into the heart through the pulmonary veins. As a result, it plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood within the body. In terms of ontogenetic development, the cardiac right ventricle forms early in embryonic life, with its precursor cells migrating to their final positions during gastrulation. The subsequent formation of the atrioventricular valves and septum is mediated by a complex interplay of transcription factors and signaling pathways. From an evolutionary perspective, the cardiac right ventricle has evolved to optimize blood flow and oxygen"
UBERON_0002081,"The cardiac atrium, also known as the atrium, is a vital chamber within the heart that serves as the primary entrance point for blood to enter the cardiac output pathway. Located on either side of the ventricles, the atria are separated from one another by the interatrial septum. In terms of anatomy, the cardiac atrium is characterized by its unique structure, comprising two distinct compartments: the superior and inferior vena cava (SVC) pouches that receive blood from the upper and lower extremities, respectively. The SVC pouches are connected to a single large atrial chamber, which is further divided into two smaller chambers: the lateral and medial portions. The atria are also defined by their function as part of the cardiac cycle. During ventricular contraction, the atrial pressure is reduced to allow blood to flow from the atrium into the ventricles via the AV valves. This process enables efficient blood ejection into the systemic circulation. In terms of physiology, the atria play a crucial role in regulating cardiac output and maintaining hemodynamic homeostasis. The size and contractility of the atrial chambers are closely related to the overall workload on the heart, with increased preload and afterload leading to greater atrial chamber expansion and increased stroke volume. The term ""atrium"" has been used interchangeably with its aliases, including cardiac chamber, ventricular chamber, and atrioventricular chamber. This is likely due to the anatomical and functional similarities between these structures. In terms of ontogeny, the development of the cardiac atrium involves a complex interplay of morphological changes during embryonic and fetal development. The atrial chambers are initially separated by a thin layer of tissue called the septum, which gradually thins and becomes obliterated as the heart forms. Overall, the cardiac atrium is a critical component of the heart's structure and function, playing"
UBERON_0002082,"The cardiac ventricle, also known as the heart ventricle, is the lower chamber of the heart that pumps blood through the arterial system to supply oxygenated blood to the body's tissues. This unique structure plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. anatomically, the ventricle is bounded by septa that divide it into two compartments: the left and right atria, which are connected by the interatrial septum. The ventricular walls are composed of myocardium, a cardiac muscle tissue that contracts to pump blood through the heart. The interventricular septum, a thin wall of myocardium, separates the ventricles and prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The ventricle's function is to contract and relax in an alternating pattern, propelling blood through the tricuspid valve (between the right atrium and right ventricle) into the pulmonary artery. This process is driven by electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized cardiac tissue that acts as the heart's natural pacemaker. The cardiac chamber system, including the ventricles, atria, and septa, works together to regulate blood pressure, flow, and circulation. The right side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is released into the alveoli for gas exchange, while the left side pumps deoxygenated blood through the aorta and other major arteries to supply oxygenated blood to the body's tissues. The ventricles' function is influenced by various regulatory mechanisms, including hormonal control (e.g., atrial natriuretic peptide), neural input, and autonomic nervous system activity. The ventricles also undergo remodeling and adaptation in response to changes in cardiac workload, pressure, and volume. In summary, the cardiac ventricle is a critical component of the"
UBERON_0002084,"The left ventricle, also known as cardiac left ventricle or left ventricle of heart, is a structural component of the left side of the thoracic cavity in the human body and many other species. It is a muscular, chambered sac that receives blood pumped by the right ventricle and pumps it into the aorta, the largest artery. Physiologically, the left ventricle is responsible for contracting and relaxing to push blood through the pulmonary arteries, which carry oxygenated blood to the lungs, and the coronary arteries, which supply oxygenated blood to the myocardium. The left ventricle's contraction force is generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node, a natural pacemaker located in the right atrium. The left ventricle has several key features that distinguish it from other cardiac chambers. It is the only chamber of the heart with two mitral valves, which allow blood to flow between the left atrium and ventricle during diastole. The left ventricle also contains a distinctive muscular layer, known as the epicardial muscle, which provides additional contractile force. The left ventricle's size and volume are influenced by various factors, including cardiac output, systemic pressure, and afterload. Cardiac output, measured in liters per minute, is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. Systemic pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury, is the pressure exerted on the left ventricle to push blood out into the circulation. The left ventricle's function is also influenced by its unique structure and innervation. It receives afferent input from the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, which provide information about changes in blood pressure and oxygen levels. Efferent output controls heart rate and contractility through the autonomic nervous system. In terms of pathology, left ventricular"
UBERON_0002094,"The interventricular septum, also known as the heart ventricular septum, is a critical anatomical structure that separates the left and right ventricles of the heart. This septum is composed of cardiac muscle cells that form a wall-like structure between the two ventricles. The interventricular septum is formed by the fusion of the septal regions of the conotruncus arteriosus, a critical embryonic structure that gives rise to the pulmonary artery and aorta. As the heart develops, this septum thickens and becomes more pronounced, eventually forming the boundary between the left and right ventricles. The interventricular septum plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow through the heart by controlling the direction of blood circulation. It is particularly important during systole (contraction phase) when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood into the aorta, while the right ventricle conveys oxygenated blood to the lungs. The interventricular septum is also significant in terms of its connection with other cardiac structures. The septal regions are separated from the atrioventricular (AV) valves by the fossa ovalis, a small triangular notch that connects the two chambers. The AV valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure proper circulation. In addition to its functional role, the interventricular septum has been an important subject in cardiac embryology and development. Studies have shown that the formation of the septal regions is closely tied to the development of the pulmonary arteries and aorta, highlighting the importance of this structure in overall cardiovascular health. The interventricular septum is also a site of pathological changes in various cardiac conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a disease characterized by thickening of the heart muscle. In HCM, the interventricular septum can become fibrotic or calcified, leading to impaired vent"
UBERON_0002099,"The cardiac septum, also known as heart septa, is a thin membranous structure that separates the two heart atria. This unique anatomical feature plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow and pressure within the heart. Structurally, the cardiac septum consists of two layers: the inner layer, which is composed of smooth muscle cells, and the outer layer, which is made up of cardiac myofibers. The septum's anterior (front) wall is formed by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, while its posterior (back) wall is formed by the septal leaflet of the pulmonary valve. The cardiac septum serves as a barrier between the atrial and ventricular spaces, preventing blood from flowing backward into the atria when the heart contracts. The septum's structure also allows for the separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, ensuring that each component receives the correct amount of oxygen and nutrients. In addition to its functional role in regulating blood flow, the cardiac septum also has a critical structural significance. It provides a framework for the development of the heart's chamber walls and guides the formation of the atrioventricular valves. The septum's intricate network of fibers and muscle cells is responsible for maintaining the heart's overall shape and structure. The name ""cardiac septum"" can be confusing, as there are several other structures within the heart that also possess similar names. For example, the cardiac septum is often referred to as part of the heart septa or heart wall. Similarly, the posterior aspect of the septum is sometimes referred to as the tricuspid annulus. Despite its complex structure and functional significance, the cardiac septum remains a relatively understudied area in the field of cardiology. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms that regulate the development, function, and pathology of this critical cardiac structure."
UBERON_0002133,"The atrioventricular valve, also known as the AV valve, is a critical component of the cardiac conduction system that separates the atrium from the ventricle, preventing backflow and ensuring proper blood circulation. Located in the septal region of the heart, the AV valve consists of two semilunar valves, one at the junction of the left and right atria (atrioventricular junction or AVJ) and another at the junction of the left and right ventricles (aortic valve or AVJ). The AV valves are composed of three layers: an outer fibrous layer, a middle fibroelastic layer, and an innermost endocardial layer. During systole, the atria contract to pump blood into the ventricles. To prevent backflow, the AV valves open and allow blood to flow from the ventricles into the atria, creating a one-way valve effect. This ensures that the ventricular output is directed towards the systemic circulation rather than being recirculated back into the atrium. The AV valves are regulated by the autonomic nervous system, with the sympathetic nervous system increasing heart rate and contractility to facilitate increased blood flow during systole. Similarly, the parasympathetic nervous system decreases heart rate and contractility during diastole, allowing for efficient filling of the ventricles. In addition to their role in regulating cardiac output, AV valves also play a crucial role in maintaining hemodynamic stability by preventing excessive backflow and ensuring proper distribution of blood throughout the body. Dysfunction or abnormalities in the AV valves can lead to various cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and valve regurgitation. The AV valves are also subject to mechanical stress due to the constant flow of blood through them during systole and diastole. This mechanical stress leads to the remodeling and hypertrophy of the atrioventricular valve leaflets over time, which can"
UBERON_0002134,"The tricuspid valve, also known as the right atrioventricular valve, is a complex structure that regulates blood flow between the right atrium and ventricle. Located in the heart's outflow tract, it plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis. Antral anatomy The tricuspid valve is situated at the junction of the right atrium (RA) and ventricle (RV). The RA receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the superior and inferior vena cavae. The AV node, a specialized bundle of fibers, separates the conduction system from the valvular apparatus. Structure The tricuspid valve consists of three cusps: anterior, posterior, and intermediate (also known as the papillary muscles). The anterior cusp is attached to the annulus fibrosus of the right atrium, while the posterior cusp is related to the interatrial septum. The intermediate cusp is a thin fibrous structure that anchors the mitral valve. Mechanism Blood flow through the tricuspid valve occurs in three phases: early rapid filling, mid-diastole, and late diastolic emptying. During early rapid filling, the atrium contracts to increase ventricular volume, pushing blood into the ventricle. In mid-diastole, the mitral valve opens, allowing blood to flow into the ventricle. Late diastole sees a decrease in pressure gradient across the AV node, facilitating atrial contraction and subsequent closure of the tricuspid valve. Function The tricuspid valve ensures that blood flows from the right atrium into the ventricle during systole (contraction), while preventing backflow during diastole. This is achieved through a complex interplay between contractility, pressure, and velocity factors. The valve's unique structure allows for precise control of blood flow,"
UBERON_0002135,"The mitral valve, also known as left atrioventricular valve (AV valve), is a critical component of the heart's outflow tract from the left atrium to the left ventricle. It plays a vital role in regulating blood flow and maintaining cardiac function. Physiologically, the mitral valve is situated at the junction of the left atrium and left ventricle, approximately 2-3 cm above the fossa ovalis. The valve itself is composed of two leaflets: an anterior (A) leaflet and a posterior (P) leaflet. The A leaflet is attached to the papillary muscles, which are responsible for regulating mitral valve closure. The mitral valve allows for controlled blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle during systole, while preventing retrograde flow when the heart contracts. This is achieved through a combination of three mechanisms: 1. **Compliance**: The mitral annulus and chordae tendineae increase the stiffness of the mitral valve leaflets, making it more difficult for blood to pass through. 2. **Pressure regulation**: The papillary muscles regulate the size of the A leaflet opening, thereby controlling the flow of blood into the ventricle during systole. 3. **Torsion**: The chordae tendineae, which connect the valve leaflets to the mitral annulus, exert a force on the leaflets that prevents retrograde flow. The term ""mitral"" refers specifically to this valve, as it is unique in its function and anatomy compared to other AV valves. The left atrioventricular valve is distinct from the tricuspid valve of the right atrium and the pulmonary valve of the right ventricle due to its location and functional role. In addition to its physiological significance, the mitral valve has also been the subject of extensive research in the fields"
UBERON_0002137,"The aortic valve is a critical component of the heart, situated between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta. This complex structure serves as a crucial barrier preventing backflow into the ventricles during systole. Structurally, the aortic valve consists of three main cusps: the anterior (anterior leaflet), right posterior (right posterior leaflet), and left posterior (left posterior leaflet). These cusps are attached to the fibrous ring, a fibrotic structure that anchors them to the aortic root. The anterior and right posterior cusps form an annulus, while the left posterior cusp is often considered part of this annulus. The functional unit of the aortic valve is the leaflet complex, comprising two opposing leaflets that are separated by a narrow interval (annulus). During systole, these leaflets converge to form a semi-circular flap-like structure. As blood flows through the ventricle during systole, it triggers the annular cusp to bulge outward, allowing blood to flow from the ventricle into the ascending aorta. The aortic valve is an example of a hinge joint, characterized by a precise and coordinated movement between opposing leaflets. The anterior leaflet moves in conjunction with the right posterior leaflet, resulting in a smooth and efficient blood flow. However, during diastole, the leaflets recede into the annulus, preventing backflow. The name ""aortic valve"" can be misleading, as it is not the sole valve responsible for regulating blood flow between the ventricles. The mitral valve, for instance, plays a crucial role in valvular heart function by controlling blood flow from the left ventricle into the left atrium. Nonetheless, the aortic valve remains an essential component of the cardiac circuit. In terms of ontological classification, the aortic valve can be understood as"
UBERON_0002146,"The pulmonic valve, also known as the pulmonary valve, is a semilunar valve located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. This valve plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. Physiologically, the pulmonic valve allows for the transition of blood from the high-pressure system of the right ventricle into the low-pressure system of the pulmonary artery. During this process, the valve opens and the blood flows through it, facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the bloodstream. The structure of the pulmonic valve is characteristic of a semilunar valve, with three cusps (annuli) that form a partial ring around the annulus of the right ventricle. The valve's leaflets are composed of two layers: an inner circular layer and an outer fibrous layer. The annulus, a ring-shaped structure, connects the cusps and helps to maintain valve function. The pulmonic valve is innervated by the right coronary artery, which supplies oxygenating blood to the myocardium of the right ventricle. In addition, it receives parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve, which modulate its contractility and prevent excessive opening during periods of increased intraluminal pressure. The pulmonic valve is regulated by various physiological mechanisms, including baroreflexes, chemoreflexes, and mechanical factors such as intravascular pressure and cardiac output. During exercise or high-intensity physical activity, the pulmonic valve may exhibit abnormal behavior, leading to increased flow through the valve and potential pulmonary hypertension. In terms of pathology, pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing or obstruction of the pulmonic valve, often resulting in right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased cardiac output. Other conditions that may affect the pulmonic valve include rheumatic heart disease,"
UBERON_0002348,"The epicardium, also known as the heart epicardium, visceral serous pericardium of the heart, or visceral serous pericardium proper from region A, is a specialized layer of tissue that forms the innermost surface and outermost envelope of the heart. It is a thickened portion of the serous membrane that envelops the myocardium, the muscular layer of the heart. The epicardium is a key component of the heart's pericardial structure, playing a crucial role in its function and development. It serves as an attachment site for various structures, including the myocardium, smooth muscle cells, and cardiac fibroblasts. The epicardium also interacts with the endocardium, the innermost layer of the pericardium, to regulate cardiovascular function. The epicardium is composed of two main layers: a thin layer of collagen-rich tissue (the adventitia) and a thick layer of smooth muscle cells (the media). These layers are separated by a fibrous connective tissue that provides support and attachment for cardiac structures. The epicardial smooth muscle cells in this region contract to help regulate heart function, particularly during systole. The epicardium also produces various growth factors and cytokines that modulate cardiac development and function. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are produced by the epicardial cells and play a role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. In addition to its structural and functional roles, the epicardium has been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as heart failure and coronary artery disease. Abnormalities in the epicardium, including fibrosis and hypertrophy, can contribute to these diseases by disrupting normal cardiac function and increasing oxidative stress. The understanding of the epicardium is essential for developing new treatments and therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Research"
UBERON_0002351,"The sinoatrial node, also known as cardiac pacemaker, is a specialized cardiac tissue responsible for regulating heart muscle contraction. Located in the right atrium, it serves as the primary controller of cardiac rhythmicity. Physiologically, the sinoatrial node functions as a ""clock"" that synchronizes the heartbeat with the electrical cycle of the heart. It relays electrical signals from the atrioventricular (AV) node to initiate contraction. The AV node, also known as the sinus node or SA nodal muscle tissue, is another critical component of the cardiac conduction system. The sinoatrial node is a subdivision of the conducting system of the heart, situated at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava, around its branch that supplies blood to the coronary arteries. This location facilitates efficient communication with the AV node through the internodal tract, a continuous pathway between these two nodes. The sinoatrial node is further divided into three parts: the nodus sinuatrialis, SA nodal muscle tissue, and sinus node of Keith and Flack. The nodus sinuatrialis refers to this portion of the node, while the SA nodal muscle tissue represents the functional units responsible for generating electrical impulses. The sinoatrial node's electrical activity is generated by an electrochemical process involving potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels. This allows it to fire at a consistent rate, resulting in a regular heartbeat. The sinus node of Keith and Flack refers to a specific variant of this tissue that exhibits unique characteristics. The functioning of the sinoatrial node can be described as a monophasic action potential, with each electrical impulse originating from the nodus sinuatrialis and propagating through the SA nodal muscle tissue. This coordinated contraction enables the heart to pump blood efficiently throughout the body. In summary, the sinoatrial node is a critical component"
UBERON_0002352,"The atrioventricular (AV) node, also known as the Aschoff-Tawara node, is a specialized conducting tissue between the atria and ventricles of the heart. It plays a critical role in regulating the normal electrical impulse that controls cardiac contraction. Characterized by a unique arrangement of myofibrils and intercalated discs, the AV node's structure enables it to facilitate rapid propagation of the action potential from the atria to the ventricles. The nodal tissue is comprised primarily of cardiomyocytes, with an abundance of gap junctions that allow for rapid electrical coupling between adjacent cells. The AV node has a distinctive dual-polarized structure, consisting of two distinct regions: the proximal and distal regions. The proximal region exhibits a more uniform arrangement of myofibrils, while the distal region features a more compact, dense packing of intercalated discs. This specialized architecture enables efficient transmission of electrical signals across the node. The AV node's function is to delay the depolarization of ventricular muscle cells, allowing for proper synchronization of contractions between the atria and ventricles. This delay period, typically ranging from 80-120 milliseconds, is thought to be mediated by a complex interplay of ion channels, including L-type calcium channels and potassium channels. The AV node's electrical properties are influenced by its unique structure, with changes in conduction velocity and action potential duration correlating with alterations in the ion channel composition. The node's pacemaker activity is also modulated by factors such as atrial contraction force and intrinsic membrane potentials. In terms of functional significance, the AV node is responsible for regulating cardiac output and maintaining a consistent ventricular contraction rhythm. Impairments or dysfunction in the AV node can lead to various cardiac arrhythmias, including atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT"
UBERON_0002353,"The atrio-ventricular (AV) bundle, also known as the atrio-ventricular fasciculus, is a complex muscular structure that plays a critical role in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Located between the atria and ventricles, the AV bundle is composed of specialized cardiac muscle fibers that are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. These fibers form a continuous sheet-like arrangement, with each fiber connected to its neighbors via gap junctions. The AV bundle consists of two main parts: the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Bundle of His. The AVN is responsible for generating and propagating the electrical activity that triggers contraction of the ventricles. It does this by transmitting signals from the atria to the AVN, which then relay them to the Bundle of His. The Bundle of His, also known as the fasciculus atrioventricularis, is a thick bundle of cardiac muscle fibers that extends from the AVN down to the Purkinje fibers. It plays a key role in the electrical conduction system by facilitating the transmission of signals from the AVN to the ventricles. The AV bundle is also known as the atrio-ventricular bundle, but this term can be misleading due to its association with the nodal structure. The AV node itself is actually part of the AVP (atrioventricular P component), which includes the AVB and the Bundle of His. The AV bundle's electrical conduction properties are influenced by factors such as the refractory period, action potential duration, and conduction velocity. These characteristics enable it to transmit signals efficiently through the heart muscle, ensuring coordinated contraction of the ventricles. The AV bundle is a dynamic structure that undergoes changes in response to various physiological conditions, such as stress, exercise, and disease. For example, an increase in sympathetic activity can lead"
UBERON_0002494,"The papillary muscle of the heart is a group of myocardial bundles that terminate in the chordae tendineae, which attach to the cusps of the atrioventricular valves. This muscular structure plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper functioning of the heart's pumping mechanism. Each ventricle has an anterior and a posterior papillary muscle, as well as a septal papillary muscle in some cases. The right ventricle sometimes has additional structures known as ""septal"" or ""pulmonary"" papillary muscles, which are located between the pulmonary valves and the right ventricular outflow tract. The papillary muscles are attached to the ventricular wall by small fibers that run transversely across the muscle fibers. These attachments serve to increase the contractility of the heart muscle and improve its pumping efficiency. The chordae tendineae, which connect the papillary muscles to the cusps of the atrioventricular valves, play a key role in regulating cardiac function. By adjusting the tension on these structures, the forces exerted by the ventricles on the atria can be modulated, ensuring proper contraction and relaxation. The papillary muscle concept is often described using the terms ""papillary muscle"" or ""myocardial bundle"", which encompasses not only this specific group of muscles but also related structures such as the interventricular septum. The study of these muscular bundles and their attachments has significant implications for our understanding of cardiac function and disease mechanisms, including heart failure and arrhythmias. The term ""papillary"" in relation to the muscle refers to its resemblance to the papillae found on the surface of some organs, such as the lungs or kidneys. In this context, it highlights the muscular structure's relationship with other anatomical features of the heart. In conclusion, the papillary muscle is a critical component of the cardiac musculature, playing"
UBERON_0003379,"The cardiac muscle of the right atrium, also referred to as cardiac muscle tissue of the right atrium, or myocardium of right atrium, is a specialized type of cardiac muscle that forms the inner lining of the right atrium. This region is rich in contractile elements and has a high degree of cellular organization. The cardiac muscle cells in the right atrium are multinucleated, with each cell containing multiple nuclei that fuse to form a single nucleus. These cells are arranged in a regular, parallel fashion to create a highly ordered structure. The cytoplasm of these cells is filled with contractile filaments, such as actin and myosin, which are essential for muscle contraction. The right atrium receives blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae and returns deoxygenated blood to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. The walls of the right atrium are lined with a layer of smooth muscle that helps regulate pressure and flow. This smooth muscle is composed of contractile units called myofibers, which can be activated to produce rapid contractions. The cardiac muscle tissue in the right atrium is also characterized by its high content of troponin T, a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating muscle contraction. Additionally, the right atrium has a unique arrangement of cells and fibers that allows it to pump blood into the pulmonary circulation efficiently. In addition to its structural characteristics, the cardiac muscle tissue in the right atrium also exhibits contractile properties that enable it to respond to changes in blood pressure and flow. This is achieved through the coordinated action of multiple ion channels and receptors, which regulate calcium release and contraction. The right atrium plays a vital role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis by regulating blood pressure and flow to different parts of the body. Its contractile properties allow it to pump blood efficiently into the pulmonary circulation, where it will eventually be oxygen"
UBERON_0003383,"Cardiac muscle tissue of interventricular septum, also known as cardiac muscle of interventricular septum; interventricular septum cardiac muscle; interventricular septum heart muscle; interventricular septum myocardium, is a type of cardiac muscle cell located in the interventricular septum, which separates the left and right ventricles. The interventricular septum is a thick layer of cardiac muscle that is composed primarily of myofibrils, which are contractile units that generate force to propel blood throughout the body. The interventricular septum is formed by the fusion of two separate cardiac muscle cells, each with its own set of myofibrils and contractile units. The primary function of cardiac muscle tissue in the interventricular septum is to maintain blood pressure and ensure proper circulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood throughout the body. The unique arrangement of myofibrils and contractile units in this region allows for efficient contraction and relaxation, enabling the heart to pump blood efficiently. The interventricular septum cardiac muscle cells are specialized by having a high concentration of gap junctions, which facilitate communication between adjacent cells and enable coordinated contractions throughout the septum. This coordinated activity is essential for maintaining a consistent cardiac output despite changes in systemic vascular resistance or other factors that may affect blood pressure. In terms of ontological classification, cardiac muscle tissue of interventricular septum can be considered a specialized type of cardiac muscle cell within the broader category of cardiomyocytes. The unique characteristics of this region, including its high concentration of myofibrils and contractile units, distinguish it from other types of cardiac muscle cells. From an ontological perspective, the concept of cardiac muscle tissue of interventricular septum is closely related to the definition of cardiomyocytes, which are a class of cells that are characterized by their contractile properties.

UBERON_0003498,"The heart-blood vessel, commonly referred to as a blood vessel of the heart, is a complex structure comprising multiple vessels that play a crucial role in the cardiovascular system's function. The coronary arteries are two primary branches that arise from the left ventricle and extend towards the atria. They are designated as the anterior descending coronary artery (ADCa) and the posterior descending coronary artery (PDCa). These vessels converge to form the diagonal artery, which then divides into the left circumflex artery (LCx) and the right coronary artery (RCA). The coronary arteries are responsible for supplying oxygenated blood to the myocardium, with a total cardiac output of approximately 2,000 mL/min. The heart-blood vessel system is highly specialized, with unique features such as the presence of collateral circulation to ensure adequate perfusion in case of reduced blood flow. The coronary sinus, an emissary venous structure, collects deoxygenated blood from the myocardium and returns it to the right atrium via the superior vena cava. The coronary sinus is a variant of the hepatic portal vein system. In addition to the coronary arteries, the heart-blood vessel network also includes smaller vessels such as the small cardiac veins and the left atrial appendage. These vessels facilitate the distribution of oxygenated blood from the heart chambers to the myocardium and aid in the removal of deoxygenated blood through the venous circulation. The complex structure of the coronary arteries and the associated heart-blood vessel system is critical for maintaining optimal cardiac function, ensuring sufficient oxygenation and nutrient delivery to the myocardium. Any disruptions or alterations to this network can lead to significant cardiovascular complications."
UBERON_0004145,"The outflow tract, also known as cardiac outflow tract, is a critical structure within the heart that facilitates the efficient transportation of blood to the arteries. This term encompasses the confluence of the left and right ventricles, where the septum (the wall of tissue separating the two ventricles) divides into the anterior and posterior parts. As blood accumulates in the left ventricle, it is forced through the outflow tract by peristaltic contractions, a process regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The outflow tract is characterized by a narrow, muscular canal that enables efficient blood flow. The cardiac outflow tract is also referred to as the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). These terms are often used interchangeably, although some anatomists distinguish between them based on their orientation or location within the heart. Anatomically, the outflow tract begins at the apex of the left ventricle, where the septum divides into the anterior and posterior parts. The valve complex at the junction of these two parts is known as the mitral valve (in the left ventricle) and the tricuspid valve (in the right ventricle). The tricuspid valve allows blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle, while the mitral valve facilitates blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The outflow tract is further divided into three regions: the anterior (left-sided) and posterior (right-sided) parts of the septum. The anterior part of the septum opens into a narrow channel that leads to the interventricular septum, while the posterior part directly communicates with the right atrium. In adults, the outflow tract is generally narrow, but in cases of obstructive cardiomyopathy or other heart conditions, it can become"
UBERON_0004148,"The cardiac vein, also known as coronary vein or heart vein, is a significant venous structure that plays a crucial role in the drainage of the myocardium. The term ""cardiac"" refers to the heart, while ""vein"" denotes a blood vessel. Physiologically, the cardiac vein emerges from the right ventricle and courses along the lateral wall of the heart, eventually emptying into the coronary sinus. This venous structure is formed by the collection of small veins that converge on the myocardium, which is the muscle tissue responsible for heart function. The cardiac vein receives oxygenated blood from various sources, including the lungs, liver, and skeletal muscles. The blood then flows through the cardiac veins to the coronary sinus, a larger vessel that drains into the right atrium. The coronary sinus collects deoxygenated blood from all regions of the myocardium and returns it to the right atrium. The coronary vein itself is typically referred to as ""cardiac vein"" in some contexts. However, the term ""heart vein"" or ""vein of heart"" is also commonly used interchangeably with cardiac veins. Some medical texts also use the alias ""coronary vein,"" which can be confusing but refers specifically to this venous structure. In terms of anatomy and physiology, the cardiac vein plays a vital role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. The blood flowing through it helps regulate myocardial oxygenation and pH levels, ensuring optimal function and contraction of heart muscle cells. Additionally, the cardiac vein's role in draining deoxygenated blood from the myocardium allows for the removal of metabolic waste products and excess ions, which are then transported to the lungs for excretion. Understanding the cardiac vein is essential in various fields, including cardiology, physiology, and biomedical engineering. Its complex anatomy and function make it a fascinating area of study, with ongoing research aimed at improving our understanding of cardiovascular health"
UBERON_0004151,"A cardiac chamber is a hollow, enclosed cavity within the heart that serves as a specialized organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. This unique structure can be further classified into distinct chambers, each with its own specific function and anatomy. The atria, also known as ""upper chambers,"" are the upper parts of the heart's chambers that receive blood from the veins. There are two atria: the right atrium (RA) and the left atrium (LA). The RA receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary vein, while the LA collects deoxygenated blood from the body. The ventricles, also known as ""lower chambers,"" are the lower parts of the heart's chambers that pump blood out to the body. There are two ventricles: the right ventricle (RV) and the left ventricle (LV). The RV pumps oxygen-rich blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery, while the LV pumps oxygen-depleted blood to the rest of the body. The atrioventricular valves (AV valves), also known as the tricuspid valve or mitral valve, control the flow of blood between the atria and ventricles. The AV valves are composed of three semilunar cusps that move in a synchronized manner to prevent backflow. In addition to these chambers and valves, the heart also contains other specialized structures, such as the septum, which divides the heart into four chambers, and the interventricular septum, which separates the ventricles. The AV node, located between the atria and ventricles, acts as a relay station for electrical impulses. Cardiac chamber anatomy is characterized by distinct regions with unique features, such as the sinus valves, which separate the right atrium from the RA, and the fossa ovalis, which connects the LA to the RA. The coronary sinus, a venous structure that"
UBERON_0005208,"The valve of the right atrium, also known as Tricuspid Valve, is a complex structure responsible for directing blood flow between the atria and ventricles. This unique valve is named after its association with the tricuspid region of the heart. Physiologically, the Tricuspid Valve is an annular flap-like structure that spans the interatrial septum, separating the right atrium from the left atrium. Its primary function is to prevent bidirectional blood flow between the atria and ventricles during cardiac contractions. Structurally, the valve consists of three cusps: two anterior (lateral) cusps and one posterior (dorsal) cusp. These cusps are bounded by chordae tendineae, fibrous strings that attach to the papillary muscles and maintain their attachment throughout the cardiac cycle. The Tricuspid Valve is unique in that it allows for the forward flow of blood from the right atrium into the right ventricle during systole (contraction) and prevents backflow. This is achieved through a complex interplay of muscle contraction, valve leaflet motion, and septal movement. During diastole (relaxation), the Tricuspid Valve relaxes, allowing blood to flow retrograde from the right atrium into the left atrium. The posterior cusp of the valve is particularly significant, as it closes during late diastole, preventing backflow and ensuring efficient ventricular filling. In terms of functional physiology, the Tricuspid Valve is a critical component of the cardiac cycle, influencing blood flow dynamics and pressure regulation within the heart. Its unique structure and function have been studied extensively in the context of cardiac diseases, such as tricuspid regurgitation, which can lead to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. The Tricuspid Valve has also been investigated in relation to vent"
UBERON_0005337,"The outflow tract of the ventricle is a critical anatomical structure that regulates blood flow from the heart to the circulatory system. In both left and right ventricles, there are two primary outflow tracts: the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The LVOT connects to the aorta, the largest artery in the body, and facilitates the transmission of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body. The RVOT, on the other hand, directs blood flow towards the lungs through the pulmonary arteries. Both tracts are infundibular extensions of the ventricular cavity, characterized by a smooth, muscular wall that enables efficient blood flow. The LVOT is nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the ventricle in terms of morphology, whereas the RVOT has distinct characteristics, including a more elongated shape and a larger diameter. The left ventricular outflow tract plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac output, with changes in pressure and volume affecting blood flow through this tract. In response to increased afterload, the LVOT constricts, reducing blood flow and increasing systemic vascular resistance. Conversely, during decreased afterload, the RVOT dilates, allowing for increased blood flow and ventricular filling. The outflow tracts of both ventricles are also subject to regulation by various hormonal and neural mechanisms, influencing cardiac function and response to stress. For example, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates the constricting of the LVOT, increasing systemic vascular resistance and promoting cardiac output, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system has a more variable effect on both tracts. The anatomy and physiology of the outflow tracts are essential for understanding various cardiovascular disorders, including congenital heart defects, hypertension, and cardiomyopathies. A thorough comprehension of these structures is necessary"
UBERON_0005438,"The coronary sinus, also known as the sinus coronarius, is a venous structure that plays a crucial role in the cardiac circulatory system. Located on the posterior surface of the heart, it receives most of the cardiac veins carrying deoxygenated blood from the myocardium and delivers it to the right atrium. Anatomically, the coronary sinus is a dilated vein that extends from the base of the pulmonary trunk to the level of the superior vena cava. It is formed by the union of three main groups of veins: the anterior cardiac veins, the posterior cardiac veins, and the coronary veins. The sinuses coronarii are the largest part of this network. The right coronary sinus originates from the anterior cardiac veins and flows into the coronary sinus through a single opening in the atrioventricular orifice, which is located between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. This connection allows for the direct return of deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the venous system. The coronary sinus then empties into the superior vena cava, where it joins with other veins to form the coronary sinuses. From there, the blood is circulated to the rest of the body through a network of pulmonary and systemic veins. The coronary sinus also serves as a reservoir for oxygenated blood from the lungs. The coronary sinus is an important structure in the cardiac circulation, and its dysfunction or obstruction can lead to various cardiovascular conditions. Abnormalities in the formation or function of the sinuses coronarii have been implicated in several diseases, including coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy. In addition to its functional role, the coronary sinus also has a unique anatomical feature: it contains mucous membranes that are richly innervated by autonomic nerves. These nerve endings play a crucial role in regulating cardiac function and blood pressure, particularly during periods of increased demand or"
UBERON_0005623,"A semilunar valve is a type of blood valve that exhibits characteristic leaf-like or crescent-shaped structures, facilitating efficient blood flow through the cardiac cycle. The name ""semilunar"" originates from its resemblance to the crescent moon shape, which is analogous to the alveoli in the lungs. This structural similarity reflects the valve's role in regulating blood flow between the ventricles and the aorta or pulmonary trunk, two major arteries responsible for delivering oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, respectively. In terms of anatomy, semilunar valves are typically found at the junctions between the atrioventricular (AV) node and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. These structures are crucial for maintaining efficient cardiac function and ensuring that blood flows in the correct direction throughout the cardiac cycle. The leaf-like structures within semilunar valves, often referred to as ""pilot channels"" or ""vortices,"" play a key role in modulating blood flow through these valve pairs. By altering the shape of these pilot channels, semilunar valves can influence the velocity of blood flow and the pressure gradient across the valve leaflets. The AV node, where the semilunar valves are located, is responsible for generating electrical impulses that trigger the contraction of the atria and ventricles. The resulting changes in atrial and ventricular volume create a pressure gradient that drives blood flow through the tricuspid and pulmonic valves, respectively. In addition to their anatomical structure, semilunar valves also exhibit distinct functional properties that contribute to their efficiency. For example, the valve leaflets can be composed of multiple cusps or ridges that act as a mechanical damper, reducing turbulent flow and minimizing energy loss during blood flow through the valve. The concept of ""septal leaflet"" is often used interchangeably with semilunar valves, particularly in the context of heart murmurs."
UBERON_0005946,"The outflow tract of atrium, also known as the outflow part of atrium, is a critical anatomical structure within the heart that plays a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure and flow. It serves as a critical pathway for ventricular contraction to occur, thereby initiating the cardiac cycle. Located at the junction of the interatrial septum and the ventricular wall, the outflow tract is a narrow channel that connects the atrium with the ventricle, allowing blood to flow from the atrium into the ventricle. This pathway is essential for maintaining proper cardiac function, as it enables the ventricle to pump blood efficiently throughout the body. The outflow tract is composed of two main components: the pulmonic valve and the aortic valve. The pulmonic valve, located at the junction of the left ventricular outflow tract and the right atrium, is responsible for directing blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. The aortic valve, situated at the junction of the left ventricular outflow tract and the left atrium, regulates blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. The outflow tract is also characterized by its unique structure, with a single-leafed or leafless pulmonic valve, which reduces energy expenditure and minimizes pressure drop during systole. Additionally, the outflow tract contains several blood vessels, including the pulmonary arteries and veins, which play a crucial role in transporting oxygenated blood to the lungs for gas exchange. The anatomy of the outflow tract is closely tied to the concepts of ventricular compliance and ventricular function. The outflow tract's narrow diameter and high pressure gradients create significant stresses on the cardiac muscle cells, necessitating precise regulation of cardiac output through feedback mechanisms such as baroreceptor-mediated reflexes. In terms of ontogeny, the development of the outflow tract involves a complex inter"
UBERON_0005956,"The anterosuperior fibrous portion of the left ventricle, specifically the aortic vestibule, is a critical structure that facilitates blood flow from the heart to the ascending aorta. It is located at the junction of the left ventricular outflow tract and the ascending aorta. Located in the anterior-superior region of the left ventricle, this portion serves as a funnel-shaped channel that directs blood into the ascending aorta. The aortic vestibule is bounded by the anterolateral leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves, which prevent backflow and ensure proper blood flow. As the blood flows from the left ventricle through the aortic valve, it enters the aortic vestibule. The structure's unique geometry, featuring a narrow transition zone between the curved anterior wall of the left ventricle and the more cylindrical ascending aorta, creates an optimal pressure gradient for blood to flow. The aortic vestibule's alveoli are small, crescent-shaped air-filled sacs that provide additional resistance to blood flow. These structures increase the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta, further facilitating blood ejection into the systemic circulation. This structure is also known as the Sibson's vestibule or vestibulum aortae. Its precise function ensures efficient blood distribution from the left atrium to the rest of the body via the pulmonary artery. In conjunction with the left ventricular outflow tract and the semilunar valves, the aortic vestibule plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac hemodynamics and ensuring proper blood flow throughout the cardiovascular system. The intricate geometry and pressure gradients within this structure enable the efficient delivery of oxygenated blood to tissues and organs."
UBERON_0005965,"The outflow part of the right atrium, also known as the main part of the right atrium, is a crucial component of the heart's functional unit. It is a specialized region that serves as a conduit for blood flow from the body into the venous system. Structurally, the outflow part of the right atrium consists of two main components: the wall and the cavity. The wall is composed of cardiac muscle fibers that form a thin layer, while the cavity is essentially a depression or basin within which these muscles reside. This arrangement creates a muscular, tubular structure with a smooth inner surface. The outflow part of the right atrium is further divided into two main parts: the inferior and superior parts. The inferior part is located anteriorly (toward the front) and is connected to the body via the tricuspid valve, which allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the ventricle. The superior part of the outflow part is situated posteriorly (toward the back) and is in direct communication with the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve. This connection enables blood to flow from the tricuspid valve into the pulmonary artery, which then carries it to the lungs for oxygenation. The tricuspid valve is a critical component of both the outflow part and the tricuspid valve itself. Located between the inferior and superior parts, this valve allows blood to flow in one direction while preventing it from flowing backward. The tricuspid valve consists of three leaflets: an anterior leaflet that closes against the left ventricle's mitral annulus, a middle leaflet that opens to allow blood to flow into the right atrium, and a posterior leaflet that closes against the right ventricle's pulmonary valve. The outflow part of the right atrium plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac output and ensuring proper blood circulation. Its"
UBERON_0005966,"The outflow part of the left atrium, also known as the main part of the left atrium, is a critical structure within the cardiac chamber. It plays a vital role in the regulation of blood flow and pressure within the heart. Located at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the pulmonary veins (PV), the outflow tract of the left atrium is a narrow passageway that connects these two vessels to form the semilunar valve. This valve, also known as the tricuspid valve in the right atrium, allows blood flow from the SVC and PV into the right ventricle. The main part of the left atrium serves as a reservoir for blood, storing oxygenated blood before it is pumped out into the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary arteries. During diastole, the left atrium contracts to pump this stored blood into the pulmonary veins, which then flow into the lungs to be oxygenated. This process is crucial for maintaining proper cardiac output and overall cardiovascular health. The outflow tract of the left atrium is composed of a thickened layer of smooth muscle cells, which contract to prevent excessive backflow into the left atrium during systole. The semilunar valve itself is comprised of three cusps: an anterior cusp, a posterior cusp, and a septal cusp. These cusps are interconnected by a fibrous ridge that provides additional structural support. The outflow part of the left atrium is also closely associated with the AV node (atrioventricular node), which acts as a delay mechanism between the contraction of the atria and ventricles, ensuring coordinated cardiac activity. The AV node is situated within the outflow tract and plays a critical role in regulating heart rate and synchronizing cardiac contractions. In summary, the outflow part of the left atrium is a complex structure that serves as a"
UBERON_0005985,"A coronary vessel, also known as from cardiac sinus arterioles, is a specific type of arterial structure that plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the myocardium. Located within the atria, these vessels are formed by the fusion of two or more cardiac sinus arteries. Cardiac sinus arteries are a subset of the systemic venous system, which supplies blood to the heart and other organs. They originate from the superior vena cava or the inferior vena cava, depending on their origin, and merge to form a single coronary vessel. The coronary vessels branch into smaller arterioles that supply the myocardium with oxygenated and nutrient-rich blood. Coronary vessels are characterized by their high-pressure and low-resistance flow characteristics, allowing for rapid delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the cardiac muscle cells. They also exhibit unique features, such as a thick muscular layer and a rich capillary network, which facilitate efficient exchange of gases and metabolites. One of the key functions of coronary vessels is to regulate cardiac output in response to changes in myocardial metabolic demand. When the myocardium experiences increased oxidative stress or energy demands, the coronary arteries constrict, reducing blood flow to the myocardium and increasing oxygen delivery through vasoconstriction. Conversely, when the myocardium is underperfused, the coronary vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and oxygen delivery. Coronary vessels are also involved in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and disease. Abnormalities in coronary vessel structure and function have been linked to various cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Dysregulation of cardiac output and oxygen delivery can contribute to these conditions by promoting vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow, and impairing nutrient delivery. In addition to their clinical relevance, the study of coronary vessels has important implications for our understanding of cardiovascular physiology and disease mechanisms.

UBERON_0006566,"The left ventricle myocardium is a layer of cardiac muscle tissue that forms the majority of the left ventricular wall, accounting for approximately 70-80% of its total volume. This region is characterized by a unique structure and function, enabling the heart to pump blood efficiently throughout the body. Morphologically, the left ventricle myocardium is composed of a thickened outer layer (epicardial part) and a thin, fibrotic inner layer (endocardial part). The epicardial part is formed by an avascular, loose network of cardiac myofibers, while the endocardial part is primarily composed of loose connective tissue and sparse collagen fibers. This differential organization allows for efficient contraction and relaxation mechanisms. Physiologically, the left ventricle myocardium plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac function, particularly during systolic contraction. The thickened epicardial myofibers undergo significant shortening during systole, contributing to the development of an early diastolic recoil. This recoil is essential for maintaining cardiac chamber pressures and preventing excessive dilation. In terms of contractile function, the left ventricle myocardium exhibits unique properties that enable it to withstand the high pressure and flow demands of pumping blood throughout the body. The thickened epicardial myofibers are capable of generating a significant portion of the ventricle's contractile force during systole, while the endocardial part contributes minimally. Myocarditis, an inflammatory condition affecting the myocardium, can disrupt normal cardiac function and lead to significant morbidity. In contrast, hypertrophy is a more common adaptive response to increased workload or stress, where the left ventricle myocardium undergoes changes in size, shape, and contractile properties to accommodate the demands of pumping blood. The concept of myocardial remodeling has been extensively studied, with evidence suggesting that chronic hypertension, aging"
UBERON_0006567,"Right ventricular myocardium, also known as the myocardium of the right ventricle, is a specific type of cardiac muscle tissue that forms part of the heart's right ventricle. This myocardium consists of a heterogeneous population of contractile cells, including myofibers, cardiomyocytes, and accessory cells. The right ventricular myocardium exhibits a distinct morphological and functional profile compared to other types of myocardium. It is characterized by a more complex organization of fibers, with a higher proportion of fibrotic and degenerative changes. The myocardial architecture of the right ventricle is typically less ordered than in left ventricle, with a greater presence of interstitial tissue. The right ventricular myocardium also exhibits unique molecular and cellular characteristics, including elevated levels of certain proteins such as troponin I and C-protein. These alterations are thought to be involved in the regulation of contractility and relaxation, as well as the modulation of fibrotic processes. Right ventricular myocardium has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, dilatation, and dysfunction. The development of cardiac amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of insoluble fibrils composed of beta-2 microglobulin and other proteins, has also been associated with right ventricular myocardial involvement. In terms of its functional role, the right ventricular myocardium plays a critical part in regulating blood pressure and circulating volume. The contraction and relaxation of right ventricular myocardium are essential for maintaining systemic vascular resistance and perfusion to vital organs. Overall, the right ventricular myocardium is a complex tissue with unique characteristics that enable it to perform specific functions. Its involvement in various pathological processes highlights the importance of this tissue in maintaining cardiac function and overall cardiovascular health."
UBERON_0006958,"The great cardiac vein is a significant vascular structure that plays a crucial role in the circulatory system. It originates at the apex of the heart, situated along the anterior longitudinal sulcus, and ascends towards the base of the ventricles. This vein then curves to the left within the coronary sulcus, eventually reaching its terminus in the left extremity of the coronary sinus. The great cardiac vein is a branch of the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left main coronary artery (LMCA), although it can arise from either source. The RCA supplies blood to the anterior wall of the ventricles, while the LMCA provides oxygenated blood to the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The great cardiac vein receives tributaries from both atria and ventricles via two main branches: the left marginal vein. This significant vessel ascends along the left margin of the heart and contributes to the development of the coronary sinus, which is a large venous structure that collects deoxygenated blood from multiple sources. Upon entering the coronary sinus, the great cardiac vein merges with other veins to form the superior and inferior vena cava. These veins then drain into the right atrium, eventually joining with the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. The great cardiac vein's terminal branch, the left marginal vein, divides into two smaller branches: the anterior interventricular branch and the posterior interventricular branch. The anterior interventricular branch supplies blood to the anterior wall of the left ventricle, while the posterior interventricular branch drains blood from the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The great cardiac vein is an essential component of the cardiovascular system, playing a critical role in maintaining proper circulation and oxygenation throughout the body. Its unique structure and function make it a fascinating subject of study for biologists and physiologists alike."

It arises from the apex of the heart, extending upwards through the posterior longitudinal sulcus, and terminates in the coronary sinus near its right extremity. Located within the myocardium, this vein receives blood from various parts of the left ventricle, including the anterior interventricular groove, the anterior wall, and the inferior wall. The middle cardiac vein is particularly noteworthy for its unique association with the posterior interventricular artery, which is a branch of the right coronary artery. The name ""middle"" in this context likely refers to the fact that it originates from the apex of the heart, rather than being located centrally within the ventricle. The anterior interventricular groove and surrounding myocardium provide a conduit for the middle cardiac vein to ascend towards its eventual termination in the coronary sinus. As the middle cardiac vein ascends through the posterior longitudinal sulcus, it gives rise to smaller tributaries that ultimately converge with other coronary sinuses. These confluence points are critical in understanding the branching pattern of the coronary circulation and the distribution of myocardial blood flow. The middle cardiac vein plays a vital role in facilitating the transport of deoxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the coronary sinus, where it can be pumped into the right atrium or bypassed through the superior vena cava. The presence of this vein highlights the complex interplay between the heart's chambers and the surrounding cardiac structures. In terms of embryology, the middle cardiac vein is thought to have evolved from a primitive venous structure that arose during the early stages of heart development. Its development and branching pattern may provide insights into the patterning of the coronary circulation in human embryos. Further research on the middle cardiac vein is essential for understanding its role in regulating myocardial blood"
UBERON_0011820,"The atrioventricular region, also known as the AV node or AV junction, is a critical anatomical structure in the heart that plays a pivotal role in cardiac conduction. Located between the atria and ventricles, this region serves as a critical relay station for electrical impulses. The atrial-ventricular region is bounded by the septum, which separates the left and right atria from the interatrial septum, separating the left and right ventricles from the interventricular septum. The AV node is typically described as an electrical node that separates the atrial electrical conduction system from the ventricular electrical conduction system. It acts as a delay line, allowing time for the atria to fill with blood before the ventricles contract. This delay ensures a coordinated contraction of the heart muscle, enabling efficient pumping of blood. The AV node is composed of a group of cells, known as cardiac myocytes, that are specialized for electrical conduction. These cells have a unique structure, featuring a complex network of ion channels and canals that allow the transmission of electrical impulses. The AV node also contains a layer of epithelial cells that facilitates electrical conduction. The atrioventricular region is innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) and the sympathetic nervous system, which modulate heart rate and contractility in response to various physiological signals. The AV node also contains specialized receptors, such as pacemaker cells, that regulate its firing pattern. In normal functioning, the atrioventricular region operates as a unified electrical unit, allowing for synchronized contraction of the heart muscle. However, under pathological conditions, such as arrhythmias or electrical disturbances, the AV node can become disrupted, leading to abnormal cardiac conduction and potentially life-threatening complications."
UBERON_0018674,"The cardiac vasculature, also known as the heart vasculature, is a complex network of tubular structures that facilitate the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products between the heart muscle cells and the surrounding tissue. Located within the myocardium, the cardiac vasculature consists of a labyrinthine arrangement of capillaries, arterioles, and venules. These vessels are characteristic of the ""heart vasculature"" concept and differ from other types of vascular networks in their highly specialized structure and function. The cardiac vasculature is composed of two main layers: an innermost layer of endothelial cells that line the capillaries, and an outer layer of smooth muscle cells that regulate vessel diameter. The capillary walls are characterized by a unique composition of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagens, elastin, and laminins. The cardiac vasculature is particularly adapted for efficient exchange, with features such as high blood flow velocities (up to 5 m/s) and low resistance (less than 1 mmHg). This enables the heart muscle cells to receive a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients while expelling waste products, such as lactic acid and CO2. In addition to its structural adaptations, the cardiac vasculature is also specialized for rapid reperfusion after ischemia. The network's unique structure allows for the formation of microcirculatory beds that can rapidly restore blood flow and oxygenation to tissue in response to acute injury or disease. The cardiac vasculature plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating the body's response to stress and injury. The complex interplay between the cardiac vasculature, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells ensures that this vital system remains highly functional and efficient in maintaining optimal cardiac function. The concept of the cardiac vasculature has been extensively studied using advanced imaging techniques such as"
UBERON_0035374,"The small cardiac vein, also known as the right cardiac vein, is a unique structure that plays a crucial role in the circulatory system. Located parallel to the right coronary artery within the coronary sulcus, this vein drains blood into the right extremity of the coronary sinus. Anatomically, the right cardiac vein arises from the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery, which is a major supplier of oxygenated blood to the myocardium. The origin of this vein is often overlooked in standard anatomical descriptions, but it is essential for understanding its function and importance. The right cardiac vein then courses along the posterior aspect of the heart, accompanying the right ventricle as it descends into the right atrium. At this point, it divides into two main branches: a proximal branch that drains blood from the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery, and a distal branch that supplies blood to the right atrium. As the vein traverses the right atrium, it becomes more superficial and eventually enters the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus is a large, venous collection vessel that receives deoxygenated blood from the myocardium and drains it into the right atrium via the small cardiac veins, including the right cardiac vein. The name ""small"" in this context likely refers to the fact that the right cardiac vein is one of the smallest cardiac veins. In comparison to other cardiac veins, such as the left anterior descending coronary vein or the posterior descending coronary vein, which are often larger and more prominent, the small cardiac vein occupies a distinct niche in the circulatory system. The right cardiac vein's unique location and function make it an important structure for understanding cardiac development, pathophysiology, and disease mechanisms. Abnormalities in this vein, such as stenosis or ischemia, can lead to changes in blood flow and oxygenation of the myocardium, contributing to"
UBERON_0035422,"The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is a critical supply route for the myocardium of the heart, supplying blood to the lateral wall and anterior interventricular septum. It arises from the continuation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which runs perpendicular to the anterior interventricular branch of the LAD on the left side of the interventricular sulcus. The circumflex artery bifurcates into two major branches: the right circumflex coronary artery and the left circumflex branch. The left circumflex branch then divides further into smaller branches that supply the lateral wall, posterior descending artery, and inferior septum. The left circumflex branch originates from the LAD, which itself arises from the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. This sequence of origin and branching is typical in humans and other mammals, where the left main coronary artery typically divides into two branches: the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left circumflex coronary artery. The circumflex artery plays a crucial role in maintaining myocardial perfusion to the lateral wall and septum during periods of ischemia. The left circumflex branch is particularly important for supplying blood to the inferior septum, which receives approximately 50% of the cardiac output. In terms of anatomy, the circumflex coronary artery can be distinguished from other branches based on its course and relationship to the surrounding myocardium. The LAD typically divides into two branches at the level of the right atrioventricular groove, with the RCA arising anteriorly and the left circumflex branch posteriorly. The use of terms like ""ramus circumflexus"" and ""sinistra"" is a reminder that anatomical descriptions can be nuanced and context-dependent. In some species, such as rodents, the circumflex coronary artery may arise from a different origin or branch. In conclusion, the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery plays a"
UBERON_0035553,"The left cardiac chamber, also known as the left atrium, is a critical structure within the heart that plays a vital role in the circulatory system. Located on the left side of the heart, it receives oxygen-depleted blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body through the systemic circulation. Physiologically, the left cardiac chamber is composed of two main chambers: the superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC). The SVC drains deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body, while the IVC drains oxygenated blood from the lower half of the body. The left atrium receives both of these chambers through their respective junctions with the superior and inferior vena cavae. The left atrium is a siphonal chamber, meaning it has a narrow, constricted area at its apex (inferior vena cava) that impels blood forward, creating a pressure gradient. This pressure gradient drives blood flow into the left ventricle through the tricuspid valve. The left atrium also contains various blood vessels, including veins and small arterioles, which contribute to its unique properties. In terms of function, the left cardiac chamber is responsible for regulating blood flow, filtering out oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and storing red blood cells. The left atrium's muscular wall, composed primarily of myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, allows it to change shape in response to changes in pressure and volume. Anatomically, the left cardiac chamber is bounded by several structures, including the left ventricle, left pulmonary artery, and the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus is a venous structure that collects deoxygenated blood from the myocardium and returns it to the right atrium. The left cardiac chamber's unique shape and dimensions allow for efficient mixing of"
UBERON_0035554,"The right cardiac chamber, also referred to as the right atrium (RA) or right ventricle (RV), is a vital component of the heart's structure and function. In terms of anatomy, it refers specifically to the upper portion of the heart's right side. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cavae and returns it to the left atrium via the coronary sinus. This process is facilitated by the sinoatrial (SA) node, which initiates the cardiac cycle, and the tricuspid valve, which separates the RA from the AV junction. The right ventricle pumps oxygenated blood from the RA into the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs for gas exchange. The RV also receives systemic venous return via the coronary sinus. Notably, the RA is divided into two chambers: the superior and inferior vena cavae enter at the junction of these two veins. The right atrium's structure includes: * A thick-walled wall composed of muscular tissue * A thin-walled chamber with a variable diameter * The sinoatrial node located near the junction of the superior and inferior vena cavae * The tricuspid valve separating the RA from the AV junction The right ventricle is characterized by: * A thick-walled wall composed of muscular tissue * A thin-walled chamber with a variable diameter * The tricuspid valve separating the RV from the pulmonary artery Both chambers are interconnected, and their functioning relies on precise coordination. The RA receives deoxygenated blood from the body via systemic veins and pumps it to the lungs, while the RV pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. The right atrium's role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis is critical, as any disruptions can lead to significant physiological consequences. Dysfunctions of"
