M0001553,"The aortic valve is a critical component of the heart's circulatory system, situated between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta. This complex structure is responsible for regulating blood flow in one direction, preventing backflow into the left ventricle. Physiologically, the aortic valve consists of two leaflets: the anterior (or primary) and posterior (or secondary). The anterior leaflet is thicker and more muscular, while the posterior leaflet is thinner and less muscular. During systole, the atrioventricular (AV) valves, including the mitral and tricuspid valves, constrict to prevent backflow into the left ventricle. In contrast, the aortic valve exhibits unique characteristics due to its proximity to the aorta, which is under high pressure during systole. The annular ridge, a circular structure surrounding the root of the aorta, serves as an attachment site for the aortic valve leaflets. The leaflets are held in place by the aortic septum, a wall of cardiac muscle separating the left and right sides of the heart. The aortic valve is classified into two types: natural and prosthetic. Natural valves, including the aortic valve, are composed of native tissue or cartilage that has undergone fibrosis and hypertrophy over time. Prosthetic valves, on the other hand, consist of synthetic materials such as plastic or mechanical devices. Aortic valve dysfunction can lead to various clinical presentations, including regurgitation (backflow), stenosis (narrowing), or insufficiency (leaky). Regurgitant aortic valve disease is characterized by the excessive backflow into the left ventricle during diastole. This condition can result in symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Stenotic aortic valve disease presents with reduced cardiac output and exercise intolerance due to impaired blood"
M0001928,"The atrioventricular node, also known as the atrioventricular nodes or AVNPs, is a small nodular mass of specialized muscle fibers located in the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus. This structure gives rise to the atrioventricular bundle of the conduction system of the heart. The atrioventricular node plays a crucial role in regulating the electrical activity of the heart, specifically controlling the conduction between the atria and the ventricles. It acts as a ""gatekeeper"" for the ventricular depolarization, allowing it to only transmit signals that are appropriately timed with the atrial contractions. The atrioventricular node is composed of a network of specialized cardiac cells, including Purkinje fibers, which facilitate rapid transmission of electrical impulses across the heart. These specialized cells are organized into small nodules, each containing a cluster of terminal branches and a central axon. The conduction through the atrioventricular node is primarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system, with the sympathetic nervous system promoting faster conduction and the parasympathetic nervous system slowing it down. This autonomic regulation ensures that the heart's electrical activity is synchronized with the body's physiological needs. The atrioventricular node is also involved in the modulation of cardiac rhythm, allowing for the refinement of the ventricular contraction waveform. The node's unique structure and function enable it to transmit signals efficiently across the heart, ensuring proper coordination between the atria and ventricles. In addition to its functional role in regulating cardiac conduction, the atrioventricular node has also been implicated in various pathological processes, such as arrhythmias and cardiac disease. Research continues to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these conditions, highlighting the importance of this complex structure in maintaining overall cardiovascular health."
M0003026,"The Bundle of His, also known as His Bundle, is a unique bundle of cardiac muscle fibers that originates in the atrioventricular (AV) node and extends into the membranous part of the interventricular septum. This specialized group of fibers plays a crucial role in the conduction of electrical impulses to the heart's ventricles during systole. The Bundle of His is composed of two distinct components: the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. The left bundle branch arises from the AV node, while the right bundle branch originates from the muscular part of the interventricular septum. Both branches converge at theBundle of His conus, which further divides into the posterior and anterior fascicles. The Bundle of His conducts electrical impulses to the heart's ventricles through a specialized region known as theHis Purkinje fibers. These fibers are highly specialized for rapid conduction, allowing for efficient transmission of electrical signals from the AV node to the ventricular muscle cells. In terms of anatomy, the Bundle of His is located in the posterior wall of the left and right atria and extends into the posterior part of the interventricular septum. It descends through the myocardium, eventually dividing into the posterior fascicles that converge at theBundle of His conus. The electrical properties of the Bundle of His are characterized by high conduction velocities (up to 5 times that of normal ventricular tissue) and short refractory periods. This allows for rapid depolarization of the cardiac muscle cells, leading to synchronized contraction of the heart's ventricles during systole. As a critical component of the cardiac conduction system, the Bundle of His plays a vital role in regulating heart rhythm and maintaining proper ventricular function. Damage or dysfunction to theBundle of His can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias, including atrioventricular block and ventricular fibrillation."
M0004331,"Chordae Tendineae, also known as Tendineae, Chordae, are fibrous cords that connect each cusp of the two atrioventricular heart valves to papillary muscles in the heart ventricles. These specialized structures play a crucial role in regulating the dynamics of cardiac contractions. Located between the cusps and papillary muscles, chordae tendineae form an integral part of the cardiac apparatus. Their primary function is to maintain the proper alignment of the atrioventricular valves during systolic contraction. During ventricular systole, the chordae tendineae contract in unison with the papillary muscles, ensuring that the valves open and close in a coordinated manner. The structure and function of chordae tendineae are closely related to those of the Aortic Sinus (SAHA) and Mitral Sinus (MSA), which also transmit atrioventricular pressures. The SAHA and MSA are paired structures with identical morphology, while they differ in their orientation and association with the atrioventricular valves. The chordae tendineae consist of three main components: the muscle fibers attached to the papillary muscles, the tendon that connects them to the cusps, and the ligament or annulus that surrounds the tendon. The muscle fibers are composed of cardiac myocytes that contract during systolic contraction, which results in a tightening of the chordae tendineae. Chordae tendineae have several key features that contribute to their function. They are arranged in series along the length of the atrioventricular valves, with the muscle fibers and tendon fibers alternating between cusp-to-cusp connections and valve-to-valve attachments. The annulus surrounding the tendon also plays a crucial role in transmitting forces between the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. In addition to their structural and functional characteristics, chordae tendineae"
M000605189,"Pericardial Fluid, also known as Fluid, Pericardial; Fluids, Pericardial; Pericardial Fluids, is a complex biological system that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of the heart. The pericardium, a serous membrane that encloses the heart, forms a sac around the heart's chambers. The visceral pericardium surrounds the heart's viscera, while the parietal pericardium is attached to the sternum and ribs. Between these two layers lies the pericardial cavity, where Pericardial Fluid accumulates. Pericardial Fluid is a complex mixture of serous, mucinous, and emulsified substances produced by the heart's pericardial cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. The fluid serves multiple functions, including: 1. Lubrication: Pericardial Fluid reduces friction between the heart's chambers and the surrounding tissues, facilitating smooth motion and reducing wear and tear. 2. Dehydration control: The fluid helps regulate the heart's water balance by controlling the amount of fluids entering or leaving the cardiac chambers. 3. Immune function: The pericardial cells produce inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and cytokines, which help activate the innate immune response to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. 4. Coagulation regulation: Pericardial Fluid contains coagulating proteins, like fibrinogen and thromboplastin, which contribute to blood clotting. The composition of Pericardial Fluid can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, and underlying health conditions. For example, Pericardial Fluid is typically more eosinophilic in individuals with rheumatic heart disease or pericarditis. Dysregulation of Pericardial Fluid has been implicated in various"
M0006876,"The ductus arteriosus is a critical vascular structure in fetal life that allows blood flow between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, bypassing the lungs and the adult circulatory system. Located in the thoracic cavity, the ductus arteriosus connects the left subclavian artery to the proximal descending aorta, creating a shunt that redirects oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the systemic circulation. This connection is critical for fetal development, as it allows for the continued growth and maturation of the pulmonary vasculature. The ductus arteriosus is typically present in the fetus until around 37-40 weeks of gestation, at which point it gradually closes due to hormonal changes. The most common cause of ductal closure is the increase in maternal estrogen levels after delivery, leading to a decrease in the production of endothelin-1, a potent vasodilator that normally inhibits ductus arteriosus closure. The ductus arteriosus plays a crucial role in maintaining fetal hemodynamics and preventing hypoxia. However, its closure can lead to complications in newborns, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and pulmonary hypertension. The ductal closure also triggers an inflammatory response, which can lead to the formation of granulation tissue and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. The term ""ductus arteriosus"" is often used interchangeably with ""arteriosus,"" although some sources reserve the latter term for more complex or abnormal vascular connections. However, in a broader sense, the ductus arteriosus refers to any shunt that allows blood flow between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta. The ductus arteriosus is an essential component of fetal development, but its premature closure can have significant implications for newborn health. Understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying ductus arteriosus closure is crucial for developing effective treatments and therapies aimed at preventing or"
M0007395,"The endocardium is a critical component of the cardiovascular system, comprising the innermost layer of the heart and surrounding structures. This layer is characterized by a unique morphology and function that plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac integrity and promoting healthy vasculature. The endocardium is composed of endothelial cells, which are specialized epithelial cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels, including the heart. These cells possess characteristics of both epithelial and connective tissue cells, allowing them to produce a rich network of capillaries and venules that facilitate fluid exchange with the bloodstream. The endocardium is also characterized by a thin layer of extracellular matrix, which provides mechanical support and structural integrity to the endothelial cells. This matrix is composed of various proteins and glycoproteins, including collagen, elastin, and laminin, that provide resistance against shear stress and maintain cell-cell adhesion. The endocardium plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow and pressure within the heart chambers. The innermost layer of the ventricular wall, known as the endocardial layer, is specifically adapted to withstand high pressures and shear stresses generated by cardiac contraction. The endothelial cells in this layer produce a rich network of capillaries that allow for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products with the surrounding tissue. The term ""endocardium"" can refer to other structures within the heart as well, including the endocardial layer of the atria and the septum between the left and right ventricles. These layers are also composed of endothelial cells and extracellular matrix, but have distinct morphological and functional characteristics that distinguish them from the endocardium. The concept of endocardium is closely related to other cardiovascular structures, such as the myocardium (the innermost layer of the heart muscle) and the epicardium (the outermost layer of the heart). These"
M0008401,"The fetal heart is a complex organ that undergoes significant development and maturation throughout the postembryonic period, distinct from its embryonic counterpart. The embryonic heart, also known as the HEART/embryology stage of development, consists of a single chamber, the atrium, which receives oxygenated blood from the placenta. This primitive heart is characterized by a simple tube-like structure, devoid of valves or septa, and lacks the complex blood flow patterns that will emerge in the mature form. In contrast, the fetal heart develops from multiple-chambered embryonic structures, including the septum transversale, which separates the right and left atria. These chambers gradually undergo differentiation, with the formation of a more efficient circulatory system. The ventricles begin to develop, while the atrioventricular valves and septa emerge, allowing for more complex blood flow patterns. As development progresses, the fetal heart expands in size and complexity, incorporating the development of cardiac muscles, connective tissue, and blood vessels. The formation of the pulmonary arteries and veins, as well as the development of the ductus arteriosus, allows for efficient gas exchange between the mother's bloodstream and the fetus's lung tissue. The fetal heart also undergoes significant changes in response to maternal physiology, including adaptations to high blood pressure, cardiac output, and oxygen delivery. These adaptations enable the fetus to maintain a stable internal environment despite the increased demands placed upon it by maternal circulation. The term ""fetal"" specifically refers to the postembryonic period, during which the heart undergoes significant development and maturation. This stage is distinct from the embryonic period, marked by primitive heart structures and basic blood flow patterns. The fetal heart is a complex, dynamic organ that plays a critical role in maintaining the health and well-being of the developing fetus. In adult mammals, the mature fetal heart develops into the"
M0009936,"The heart, also known as the atrioventricular (AV) node or septum transversum, is a complex organ composed of two main parts: the endocardium and myocardium. The endocardium is the innermost layer of the heart, lining the chambers and valves, while the myocardium is the middle layer, consisting of cardiac muscle cells. From an ontological perspective, the heart can be understood as a holistic entity with a defined set of properties and relationships. Its primary function is to maintain the circulation of blood throughout the body, ensuring oxygenated and nutrient-rich blood reaches vital organs and tissues. The heart's structure consists of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The left side of the heart has a right atrium that receives deoxygenated blood from the body through superior and inferior vena cavae, and a right ventricle that pumps oxygenated blood to the lungs via pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. The left side of the heart has a left atrium that receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via pulmonary artery, and a left ventricle that pumps deoxygenated blood to the rest of the body through a network of arteries. The AV node is a specialized cardiac conduction tissue located between the atria and ventricles. It acts as a buffer, allowing electrical impulses to travel slowly from the atria to the ventricles, ensuring proper coordination of contraction and relaxation. The AV node is named after its location, situated in the septum transversum, which is an embryonic layer of tissue that separates the foregut and midgut during development. The heart also possesses a high degree of plasticity, with the myocardium able to adapt to changes in oxygen demand through mechanisms such as hypertrophy and fibrosis. This allows for efficient energy production and maintenance of cardiac function even under conditions of stress or injury."
M0009941,"The atria, also known as heart atria, are two upper chambers of the heart that receive oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary artery and deoxygenated blood from other parts of the body through the venous system. Located above the ventricles, the right atrium receives oxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae, while the left atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins. The right atrium also serves as a reservoir for blood pumped by the right ventricle, preparing it for transmission to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. In contrast, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae, while deoxygenated blood returns through the coronary sinus. The left atrium also contains the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium from the ventricle, allowing blood to flow in one direction only. Both atria are approximately 4-5 cm in length and have a consistent diameter throughout their length. They are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells and myofibroblasts lining the inner surface, with a rich network of capillaries and venules forming the interstitial space. The atrial walls are surrounded by a thin layer of connective tissue, which helps maintain the structure and function of the chambers. The atria play a critical role in maintaining cardiac function by regulating blood flow and pressure. During systole, the right atrium contracts to pump oxygenated blood into the ventricle, while the left atrium relaxes and receives deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins. This process is regulated by the heart rate and contractility of the ventricles. In addition to their functional role in pumping blood, the atria also have a unique structure that allows them to adapt to changing demands on the heart. The atrial walls contain"
M0009948,"The Heart Conduction System (HCS) is a complex, highly specialized cardiac tissue responsible for generating and distributing electrical impulses to coordinate cardiac contractions. This system consists of multiple components, including the sinoatrial node (SAN), atrioventricular node (AVN), bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers. The SAN, located in the right atrium, acts as a pacemaker, initiating depolarizations that propagate through the atrial tissue, generating a heartbeat. The AVN, situated between the SA and ventricles, relays electrical signals to the ventricular muscle, facilitating coordinated contraction. The bundle of His, a bundle of cardiac fibers extending from the SAN to the ventricles, transmits electrical impulses to the ventricular muscle, ensuring efficient contraction. Purkinje fibers, terminal branches of the AVN, rapidly constrict blood vessels and slow heart rate through their conduction function. The HCS is characterized by its high level of electrical specialization, with unique ion channels and molecular structures that facilitate rapid transmission of electrical signals. The SAN and AVN possess a high degree of synaptic plasticity, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments to the timing and strength of electrical impulses. In addition to these specialized components, the HCS also features a sophisticated network of autonomic nervous system (ANS) connections, enabling complex regulatory mechanisms that control heart rate, contractility, and vascular tone. The ANS inputs from various sensory receptors in the body stimulate HCS activity, modulating cardiac function to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The HCS's remarkable ability to generate rhythmic electrical activity allows for efficient cardiac contraction, regulating blood pressure, oxygen delivery, and nutrient supply to tissues throughout the body. Its high degree of autonomy enables the HCS to maintain a stable, coordinated heartbeat despite changes in blood flow, oxygen demand, or stress levels. Understanding the intricacies of the Heart Conduction System is"
M0009968,"Foramen Ovale is a congenital defect in the heart wall, specifically between the right and left upper chambers (atria) of a fetal heart. This anatomical structure is responsible for regulating blood flow between the systemic and pulmonary circulations during fetal development. During embryonic development, the ventricular septum, a thick wall of tissue separating the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart, fails to fuse properly at the foramen ovale. As a result, this opening remains patent, allowing unidirectional flow of blood between the systemic and pulmonary circuits. The patency of the foramen ovale is essential for maintaining proper circulation and oxygenation of the fetus. However, if left untreated, it can lead to complications during fetal development, including: * Increased risk of cardiac anomalies * Developmental delays in brain and lung growth * Inappropriate blood flow leading to tissue ischemia In adulthood, the foramen ovale typically closes spontaneously by the end of the second year of life. However, if it fails to close, it is known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO). PFOs are often considered a benign condition, but they can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. The term ""patent foramen ovale"" has been used in various contexts beyond fetal heart defects. In medicine, it refers to an opening or gap in the body's tissues or organs that allows communication between separate systems or spaces. In other fields, such as aviation and transportation, a patent foramen ovale may refer to a naturally occurring opening in the chest wall. The study of PFOs has significant implications for our understanding of cardiovascular development and disease. Research has identified various factors that contribute to the persistence of patency, including genetic mutations, environmental influences, and lifestyle factors. Understanding these mechanisms can help inform the prevention and management of PFO-related complications. In"
M0009969,"The Heart Septum, also known as the septum, is a critical structure that separates the two atria (upper chambers) of the heart from each other and the ventricles (lower chambers). This thin muscular wall plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function. Physiologically, the Heart Septum is composed of two main components: the atrial septum and the ventricular septum. The atrial septum is approximately 2-3 cm in length and is situated between the right atrium (RA) and left atrium (LA), while the ventricular septum is about 4-5 cm long and separates the right ventricle (RV) from the left ventricle (LV). The atrial septum, also known as the interatrial septum, is a relatively thin wall of tissue that forms the boundary between the RA and LA. Its thickness varies depending on the location and individual variability, ranging from 0.2 to 1 mm. In contrast, the ventricular septum is thicker and more muscular than the atrial septum, measuring approximately 1-2 cm in length. This septum separates the RV from the LV, allowing for efficient blood flow between the two chambers during systole (contraction). The Heart Septum plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac function by regulating blood flow, oxygenation, and waste removal. During exercise or stress, the increased demand on the heart requires an enhancement of cardiac output, which is primarily achieved through an increase in stroke volume. The septum also has an important role in preventing shunting (re-routing) of blood between the atria and ventricles, thereby maintaining the proper distribution of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Any abnormalities or defects in the Heart Septum can lead to heart defects, such as atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), ventricular septal"
M0009974,"Heart Valves, also known as Heart Valve; Valve, Heart; Valves, Heart, are complex structures that facilitate the unidirectional flow of blood between the heart's chambers and other circulatory pathways. The primary function of a Heart Valve is to prevent backflow or regurgitation of blood from the atria into the ventricles, preventing excessive blood volume in the atria. This ensures efficient cardiac output and maintaining a healthy pressure gradient across the valve. There are two main types of Heart Valves: Bioprosthetic and Mechanical. Bioprosthetic valves are composed of animal-derived tissues, such as pericardium or patency sphincter, grafted onto a prosthetic ring. These valves have been increasingly used in clinical practice due to their biocompatibility and relatively low risk of thromboembolic events. Mechanical valves, on the other hand, are made from synthetic materials, such as silicone or polyester, attached to a prosthetic framework. They require lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent valve thrombosis and endocarditis. Mechanical valves have been associated with an increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism. The structure of Heart Valves is characterized by two cusps, which are formed by the interaction of elastic and fibrous tissues. The anterior leaflet is typically thicker than the posterior leaflet, allowing it to prevent backflow from the atria into the ventricles. Heart Valves have been studied extensively using advanced imaging techniques, such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These studies have revealed unique mechanisms of valve function, including dynamic changes in leaflet geometry and stiffness that are influenced by mechanical loading conditions. The bioprosthetic Heart Valve has undergone significant development in recent years, with advances in materials science and tissue engineering. New prosthetic valves made from 3D-printed biocompatible materials are being explored as"
M0009975,"The heart ventricles, specifically the right and left chambers, are primary muscular pumps responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the systemic arterial circulation. These ventricles are situated in the left atrium of the right ventricle and the right atrium of the left ventricle. In adults, the right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the pulmonary veins and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. This process is facilitated by the ventricles' unique structure, which includes a thickened inner layer called the endocardial tunnel. The left ventricle, in contrast, receives oxygenated blood from the heart's systemic circulation and pumps it to the rest of the body via the aorta. The right ventricle is particularly adapted for this function due to its smaller size and thinner wall thickness compared to the left ventricle. This specialization allows the right ventricle to efficiently pump blood through the pulmonary circulation, which is rich in oxygenated blood from the lungs. In terms of biomechanics, the heart ventricles are capable of contracting and relaxing in a coordinated manner to achieve efficient pumping action. The atria, or upper chambers, contract and relax in a way that creates a pressure gradient between them and the ventricles, allowing for the ejection of blood into the systemic circulation. The left ventricle is often referred to as the ""pump"" due to its primary function of pumping oxygenated blood out to the body. Its muscular walls are capable of generating high pressures, allowing it to efficiently pump blood through the aorta and coronary arteries. Overall, the heart ventricles are critical components of the cardiovascular system, responsible for maintaining the body's homeostasis by regulating blood pressure, flow, and composition. Their unique structure and specialized function enable them to effectively pump oxygenated blood into the systemic arterial circulation, while also filtering out"
M0013957,"The mitral valve, also known as the mitral bicuspid, is a complex cardiac structure that plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart. Located at the junction of the left atrium and left ventricle, this valve is situated between the two chambers and enables the efficient transition of blood during diastole. Physically, the mitral valve consists of two leaflets: an anterior and a posterior leaflet, connected by an annulus fibrosus. During systole, these leaflets contract to open, allowing blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The valve is composed of two parts: the septal leaflet, which attaches to both the anterior and posterior leaflets via spongiosa, and the commissural leaflets, which connect the two leaflets at their midpoints. The mitral valve's function is critical in maintaining cardiac efficiency by preventing backflow during diastole. As blood flows from the left atrium into the left ventricle, it enters the vena contracta region, where it encounters the septal leaflet and is guided through a narrow channel. The commissural leaflets then engage, creating a pressure gradient that prevents retrograde flow. The mitral valve's structure and function are influenced by various factors, including age, sex, and genetic predisposition. Abnormalities in the valve's anatomy or physiology can lead to conditions such as mitral regurgitation, which is characterized by excessive backflow of blood through the valve during diastole. Other conditions, like atrial fibrillation, can also compromise the valve's function. The mitral valve has been extensively studied in the context of cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, with evidence suggesting that aging and hypertension are associated with increased valvular disease risk. The development of novel therapeutic strategies"
M0014344,"The myocardium, also known as the cardiac muscle or heart muscle, is a type of striated, involuntary muscle tissue that forms the muscular walls of the heart. It is composed of specialized cells called cardiomyocytes, which are responsible for generating blood flow by contracting and relaxing to facilitate the movement of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood throughout the body. The myocardium is characterized by its high degree of cellular organization and functional specialization, with each cardiomyocyte exhibiting a unique contractile phenotype. The contractility of the myocardium is driven by the regulation of ion channels and pumps that control the flow of ions and water across cell membranes. Myocardial tissue is made up of two main layers: the epicardium and endocardium. The epicardium, which lies beneath the outermost layer of connective tissue, is composed of fibroblasts, macrophages, and other immune cells that contribute to the maintenance of cardiac tissue integrity. The endocardium, which is in direct contact with blood vessels, contains a unique composition of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. The myocardium exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, with different regions having distinct functional properties and molecular signatures. For example, the ventricular septum has a lower concentration of myosin heavy chain, while the atrial appendage is characterized by a higher expression of gap junction proteins. These differences in gene expression and protein composition contribute to the unique functional roles of each region within the heart. The myocardium is also subject to various regulatory mechanisms that control its function and structure. These include the autonomic nervous system, which modulates cardiac output through the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which regulates blood pressure by controlling fluid balance and electrolyte homeostasis. In addition to"
M0014351,"Myofibrils, also known as sarcomeres, are complex contractile organelles found in striated muscle cells. They are composed of three primary components: actin filaments, myosin filaments, and other proteins organized in repeating units called sarcomeres. The sarcomere is a unit of structural and functional integration within the myofibril, which is a multinucleated structure composed of overlapping actin and myosin filaments. The sarcomere consists of a series of contractile units, known as Z-lines, which are separated by thick regions called IZ-lines. Actin filaments (also known as thin filaments) are long, rod-like molecules that are essential for muscle contraction. They form the framework of the sarcomere and play a crucial role in initiating and regulating muscle contraction. Myosin filaments, on the other hand, are thick, rod-like molecules that are responsible for muscle contraction. They interact with actin filaments to produce force, which is transmitted to adjacent myofibrils through the Z-line IZ-lines. Myosin heads bind to actin filaments and undergo conformational changes, resulting in the extension of actin filaments and the production of force. The organization of myosin filaments into sarcomeres is a critical aspect of muscle contraction. Each sarcomere consists of multiple Z-lines, which are separated by IZ-lines. The arrangement of myosin filaments within each sarcomere is highly coordinated, with myosin heads interacting to produce force. In addition to actin and myosin filaments, other proteins, such as tropomyosin and troponin, play important roles in regulating muscle contraction. Tropomyosin regulates the interaction between myosin heads and actin filaments, while troponin binds to tropomyosin and regulates"
M0015833,"Papillary muscles, also known as muscle papillae, are conical muscular projections from the walls of the cardiac ventricles. They are attached to the cusps of the atrioventricular valves by the chordae tendineae. These structures play a crucial role in regulating the flow of blood between the atria and ventricles. The papillary muscles are composed of smooth muscle tissue, which is responsible for contraction and relaxation. The muscular fibers of the papillary muscles are oriented in an anteroposterior (front-to-back) direction, with the contractile units being arranged in a linear fashion. This arrangement allows for efficient contraction and relaxation of the muscle fibers. The atrioventricular valves, also known as mitral and tricuspid valves, consist of two cusps separated by a narrow chordae tendineae. The papillary muscles are positioned to control the opening and closing of these valves, thereby regulating blood flow between the atria and ventricles. The function of the papillary muscles can be summarized as follows: when the atrioventricular valves open, the papillary muscles contract in an opposing manner to the direction of blood flow. This contraction pushes the cusps apart, allowing blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles. Conversely, when the valves close, the papillary muscles relax, and their contractile units unwind, resulting in a decrease in pressure within the ventricle. In addition to regulating blood flow, the papillary muscles also contribute to maintaining cardiac output by adjusting the resistance to blood flow through the ventricles. This is achieved through changes in the diameter of the atrioventricular valves and the length of the chordae tendineae. The papillary muscles are a vital component of the cardiac circuit, and their dysfunction can lead to various cardiovascular conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or mitral regurgitation"
M0016307,"The pericardium is a complex, fibro-serous sac that envelops the heart and great vessels, playing a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function and ensuring proper blood circulation. Externally, the pericardium consists of two distinct layers: an outer fibrous pericardium and an inner serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is a thick, fibroelastic layer that provides structural support and protection to the heart and great vessels. It is composed primarily of collagen fibers and smooth muscle cells. The inner serous pericardium, also known as the visceral pericardium, is a more delicate layer that rests next to the heart. It consists of an outer parietal layer facing the fibrous pericardium, as well as an inner visceral layer (epicardium) and a pericardial cavity separating these two layers. The epicardium, located between the visceral pericardium and the heart, is a thin, fibrocartilaginous layer that provides additional support to the cardiac structures. The pericardial cavity, which lies between the outer parietal and visceral pericardial layers, contains a fluid-filled space that helps to facilitate smooth blood flow between the chambers of the heart. The pericardium plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac function by regulating the pressure and volume of the heart's chambers. It does so through a complex interplay of contractile and relaxant forces, which help to maintain optimal cardiac output and rhythm. In addition to its structural and functional roles, the pericardium also contains various immunocytes and other cellular elements that contribute to its overall function. These cells are thought to play a role in modulating the inflammatory response and protecting against cardiac injury. The pericardium is subject to various pathologies, including pericarditis, which can be"
M0018141,"A pulmonary valve, also known as the tricuspid valve or right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) valve, is a crucial component of the heart's circulatory system. Located at the entrance to the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle, this valve regulates blood flow between the two chambers. The pulmonary trunk is a major artery that carries oxygen-depleted blood from the body to the lungs for gas exchange. The pulmonary valve consists of three cusps: an anterior and posterior cusp, with a middle cuspid groove separating them. These cusps are attached to the annulus fibrosus, a ring-like structure surrounding the base of the valve. When the right ventricle contracts and pumps blood into the pulmonary artery, the tricuspid valve opens, allowing blood to flow through. As the pressure in the right ventricle increases, the anterior cusp of the valve moves away from the middle groove, creating a partial obstruction to blood flow. Conversely, when the right ventricle relaxes and diastole occurs, the posterior cusp of the valve moves towards the middle groove, allowing blood to flow through. This alternating movement between the two cusps creates a pressure gradient that drives blood forward, pushing it into the pulmonary artery. The tricuspid valve is an example of an atrioventricular (AV) valve, as it regulates blood flow between the atria and ventricles. The valve also exhibits characteristics of a mitral valve in its left-sided AV valve equivalent, due to similarities in anatomy and function. In addition to its anatomical structure, the pulmonary valve has evolved unique physiological properties to facilitate efficient gas exchange. The valve's high blood pressure and pressure gradient create an environment that optimizes oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the lungs. The tricuspid valve's performance is also influenced by its elastic nature, which allows it to accommodate changes in vent"
M0018172,"Purkinje Fibers, also known as Modified Cardiac Muscle Fibers Composing the Terminal Portion of the Heart Conduction System, are specialized cardiac muscle fibers that play a crucial role in regulating heart function. These fibers originate from the bundle of His, a group of conduction fibers located within the right ventricle, and extend throughout the terminal portion of the heart conduction system. Located at the junction of the atrioventricular (AV) node and the Bundle of His, Purkinje Fibers are responsible for conducting electrical impulses from the AV node to the ventricles, initiating contraction and resulting in cardiac activity. These fibers are modified cardiac muscle fibers, meaning they have a distinct ultrastructural and molecular composition compared to other cardiac muscle fibers. The structure of Purkinje Fibers consists of three main components: the terminal cisternae, which are small, closed sacs containing the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum; the terminal myofibrils, which are composed of actin and myosin filaments; and the terminal microtubules, which provide additional support and stability to the fibers. Purkinje Fibers exhibit distinctive ultrastructural features, including a prominent terminal cisternae with a dense network of desmosomes, and terminal microtubules that are highly phosphorylated. These features enable efficient transmission of electrical impulses along the length of the fiber, allowing for synchronized contraction of the ventricular muscle. The conduction properties of Purkinje Fibers are modulated by various proteins, including sodium-potassium pumps, voltage-gated sodium channels, and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The ion channel composition and function of these proteins determine the speed and amplitude of electrical conduction along the fiber. In addition to their functional significance in cardiac conduction, Purkinje Fibers have also been studied for their potential"
M0019441,"Sarcomeres, also known as sarcomytes, are the functional units of muscle contraction, playing a crucial role in the coordinated movement and flexibility of skeletal muscles. As repeating contractile units of the myofibril, sarcomeres are composed of thick and thin filaments that interact to generate force. The myosin heads on the thick filaments bind to actin filaments, causing them to slide past one another, resulting in muscle contraction. The structure of a sarcomere is characterized by a series of Z-disks (Z-disk) or M-line bands, which are regions of the sarcomere where the thin filament interacts with the actin filament. The Z-disk serves as a binding site for the myosin heads, while the M-line band provides a region for the actin filaments to interact. The length and organization of the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber determine its contractile properties. Muscle fibers are typically organized into long, thin sheets called fascicles, with multiple sarcomeres arranged in a grid-like pattern along their length. As the sarcomeres shorten and slide past one another during muscle contraction, the muscle generates force that allows it to move or flex. The speed and efficiency of this process depend on various factors, including the number of sarcomeres per unit area, the organization of the myofibrils, and the presence of regulatory proteins. Sarcomeres are also subject to various modifications during different stages of contraction, such as the phosphorylation of myosin heads or the regulation of actin filament dynamics. These changes can significantly affect the force-generating capacity of the muscle. In summary, sarcomeres are the fundamental units of muscle contraction, with their unique structure and organization allowing for coordinated movement and flexibility in skeletal muscles. Understanding the biology of sarcomeres is essential for appreciating the complex mechanisms underlying muscle function and"
M0019898,"The sinoatrial node, also known as the sinoatrial (SA) node or SAN, is a small mass of modified cardiac muscle fibers located at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. It serves as the natural pacemaker of the heart, regulating its rhythm through electrical impulses. Electrical impulses originating from the SA node travel along the atrioventricular (AV) bundle, which connects to the atria and then to the ventricles. These impulses are generated by the sinoatrial node's unique morphology and physiology, allowing for a high degree of coordination between cardiac chambers. The SA node is composed of slow-wave activated channels that enable its pacemaker activity, while also exhibiting intrinsic properties such as refractoriness and hyperpolarization. The node's electrical activity is synchronized with the atrial contraction sequence, resulting in coordinated pumping action throughout the heart. Studies have shown that the SA node responds to various stimuli, including changes in blood pressure, body temperature, and metabolic state. It can also exhibit rhythmic variations in firing rate and amplitude, which may contribute to its role as a pacemaker. The identification of the SA node's precise location and function has been extensively studied using electrophysiological techniques. Its position within the right atrium, near the junction with the superior vena cava, allows it to receive inputs from various cardiac regions. In addition to its natural pacemaker function, the SA node has also been implicated in the initiation of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia. Understanding the mechanisms underlying SA node dysfunction is essential for developing effective treatments to mitigate these conditions. The term ""sinoatrial"" refers to the location of this cardiac structure within the right atrium, while ""node"" highlights its pacemaker function. The alias ""Sinoatrial Node"" is commonly used interchange"
M0021947,"The tricuspid valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is a cardiac structure that separates the right atrium from the right ventricle of the heart. It is a complex, three-chambered valve with three cusps (coronary, anterior, and posterior) that are positioned between these two chambers. The tricuspid valve plays a crucial role in ensuring proper blood flow through the heart. During cardiac contractions, the tricuspid valve opens, allowing oxygenated blood from the right atrium to enter the right ventricle. This process is known as regurgitation, and it occurs when the valve does not close properly. The tricuspid valve consists of three cusps that are connected by a fibrous ridge. The coronary cusp is the smallest of the three cusps and is located anteriorly (towards the front). It is attached to the fibrous ridge and has a narrow opening that allows blood to flow through. The posterior cusp is larger and is also attached to the fibrous ridge, but it has a more prominent opening than the coronary cusp. The tricuspid valve is made up of two layers: an inner layer composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue, and an outer layer composed of elastic fibers. The inner layer helps to maintain the shape of the valve and prevent damage from excessive pressure or tension. The outer layer provides mechanical strength and resistance to regurgitation. Regurgitation of blood through the tricuspid valve is a common cause of heart failure in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, patients with atrial septal defects (ASDs) or other congenital heart defects may be at increased risk of developing tricuspid regurgitation due to abnormal communication between the left and right atria. Tricuspid valve disease is often diagnosed using echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI"
M0022051,"Truncus Arteriosus, also known as Arteriosus or Truncus Arteriosus, is a congenital heart defect characterized by the failure of the atrioventricular valves to develop properly during embryonic development. This results in a single blood vessel arising from the confluence of the two ventricles, which then divides into two distinct arteries. During embryonic development, the truncus arteriosus forms as an intermediate stage between the atrioventricular canal and the early outflow tracts. Initially, it arises from the primitive nodal ring and connects the two lower parts of the truncus (the proximal part). However, as development progresses, the truncus undergoes a series of complex morphological changes, including regression and reformation. The most significant change occurs at the atrioventricular junction, where the atrioventricular valves fail to develop correctly. As a result, blood flows between the atria and ventricles through the ductus arteriosus instead of the normal outflow tracts. This condition is further complicated by the failure of the pulmonary artery to develop properly. In some cases, Truncus Arteriosus may also be associated with other anomalies, such as coarctation of the aorta or pulmonary stenosis. However, the presence of these additional defects is not required for the diagnosis. The name ""Truncus Arteriosus"" comes from the Latin words ""truncus,"" meaning ""cutting off,"" and ""arteria,"" meaning ""artery."" This refers to the fact that the single blood vessel arising from the confluence of the two ventricles can be seen as a single, unbroken artery. The term Arteriosus is also used to describe this condition, reflecting its association with abnormal arterialization. In adult life, individuals with Truncus Arteriosus may"
M0328425,"Atrial Appendage, also known as Atrial Appendages or Appendage, Atrial; is a unique anatomical structure that plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac function. Located on the left and right sides of the atria, respectively, the Atrial Appendage is a thin-walled, saccular outpocketing extending from the free edge of the interatrial septum. This appendage is typically about 1-2 cm in length and has a smooth, laminar surface. The Atrial Appendage serves several essential functions: 1. **Pulmonary Venous Connection**: The superior and inferior vena cavae drain into the right atrium, while the pulmonary veins enter through the Foramen Ovale to join the right atrium. The Atrial Appendage acts as a conduit for these venous blood flows. 2. **Regulation of Pulmonary Blood Flow**: By controlling the flow of blood from the lungs into the left atrium, the Atrial Appendage helps regulate pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output. 3. **Cardiac Output Regulation**: The Atrial Appendage's length and tension can be adjusted in response to changes in cardiac output, allowing for fine-tuned regulation of blood flow through the body. The Atrial Appendage is a remnant of the embryonic development of the atrial wall. During heart formation, the atrium separates from the ventricle during gastrulation, and the interatrial septum develops into the Foramen Ovale. However, the atrial appendages are retained in later development, likely due to their unique function in regulating pulmonary blood flow. The Atrial Appendage's structure is influenced by multiple factors, including genetic, hormonal, and environmental cues. For example, alterations in cardiac output or pressure can affect the tension and length of the Atrial Appendage, leading to changes in pulmonary blood flow. In terms"
M0400427,"Cardiac myocytes, commonly referred to as cardiac muscle cells, are striated muscle cells found in the heart. They are derived from cardiac myoblasts, which are multinucleated cells that arise from skeletal muscle progenitor cells during embryonic development. The cardiac myocyte undergoes a process of differentiation, where it develops into a mature cell with characteristic morphological features, including a rounded or polygonal shape, a large nucleus, and numerous small mitochondria. The cell membrane is typically invaginated to form the sarcomere, which is the functional unit of muscle contraction. Cardiac myocytes exhibit a unique contractile apparatus, consisting of actin and myosin filaments that interact to produce force during muscle contraction. The myosin heads bind to actin filament tropomyosin, creating a conformational change that allows for muscle contraction. The sarcomere is the functional unit of cardiac myocyte contraction, where myosin heads slide along actin filaments to produce force. This process is regulated by various signaling pathways, including calcium ion influx and potassium efflux, which control the length of thesarcomere and muscle contraction amplitude. Cardiac myocytes have a high degree of plasticity, with significant changes in their contractile properties occurring in response to different types of stimulation, such as electrical excitation or mechanical stress. This adaptability allows cardiac myocytes to adjust their contraction force and frequency to maintain optimal heart function under varying conditions. In addition to their contractile function, cardiac myocytes also possess a number of specialized functions, including the ability to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) in response to pathological stimuli. This process helps to maintain tissue homeostasis by eliminating damaged or dysfunctional cells. Overall, cardiac myocytes are highly specialized cells that play a critical role in maintaining heart function and regulating blood pressure. Their unique contractile apparatus and specialized functions allow them to"
M0400431,"Cardiac myoblasts, also known as cardiac myocytes or myocardial progenitor cells, are precursor cells destined to differentiate into cardiac myocytes, the functional units of the heart. These cells are a crucial component of cardiac development and regeneration. During embryonic development, cardiac myoblasts emerge from the mesoderm layer and migrate to the heart through the ventral septum. They undergo a series of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration, before forming clusters known as heterotrophic aggregates. In adults, cardiac myoblasts are present in small numbers within the interstitial tissue of the heart, particularly in areas such as the ventricular wall and myocardium. These cells have the ability to differentially express a range of transcription factors and proteins associated with cardiac development and function. Cardiac myoblasts can be isolated from various tissues using various methods, including enzymatic digestion, immunosuppression, or molecular biology techniques such as flow cytometry and sorting. Once isolated, they can be cultured in vitro for extended periods, allowing for the manipulation of their behavior and differentiation towards a cardiac-like phenotype. Studies have shown that cardiac myoblasts possess a unique set of characteristics, including: * Ability to differentiate into various cardiac cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells * Expression of cardiac-specific genes and proteins, such as N-cadherin, desmin, and collagen type I * Enhanced contractility and cytoskeletal organization compared to non-cardiac myoblasts The function of cardiac myoblasts in adult hearts is complex, and their role can be divided into two main phases: early embryonic development and late fetal development. During embryonic development, cardiac myoblasts play a critical role in the formation of the heart tube and the establishment of the cardiac myocardium. In contrast, during late"
M0501516,"The atrial septum, also referred to as the atrioventricular septum, is a thin membrane-like muscular structure that separates the right and left upper chambers (atria) of the heart. This anatomical barrier plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow between the two chambers. Located between the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve, the atrial septum serves as a natural valve, preventing excessive backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the left atrium. The structure is composed of dense connective tissue with thickened myofibers, which provide strength and elasticity to maintain its integrity. The atrial septum has several key features that enable its function: 1. **Anteroposterior orientation**: The septum runs anteroposteriorly, from the apex of the heart to the base, dividing the left and right atria. 2. **Transverse plane**: It is also transversely oriented, running across the midline of the heart, facilitating its separation into two distinct compartments. 3. **Laminae**: The septum consists of multiple laminae, which are longitudinal folds of tissue that increase the surface area for blood flow regulation. The atrial septum has several important functions: 1. **Regulation of right-to-left shunting**: It prevents excessive backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the left atrium, maintaining cardiac output and preventing pulmonary hypertension. 2. **Modulation of cardiac output**: The structure influences cardiac output by adjusting the flow of blood between the two chambers, ensuring optimal oxygenation and nutrient delivery to tissues. Variations in the size, shape, and orientation of the atrial septum can be observed, leading to conditions such as: 1. **Atrial septal defects (ASDs)**: A common congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the septum, allowing blood to"
M0501517,"The ventricular septum, also known as septum, ventricular, is a muscular structure separating the right and left lower chambers (heart ventricles) of the heart. Located below the aortic valve, it consists of a small membranous portion and a large thick muscular portion. Physically, the ventricular septum comprises three distinct sections: the inlet septum, the trabecular septum, and the outlet septum. The inlet septum is situated at the junction of the left and right atria, while the trabecular septum forms the inner surface of the ventricle between the aortic valve and the mitral valve. The outlet septum is located near the pulmonary valve. The ventricular septum plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow between the two ventricles. Its thick muscular walls allow for efficient contraction and relaxation, enabling the heart to pump blood efficiently. The smooth muscle cells within the ventricular septum contract and relax in a coordinated manner to maintain proper ventricular function. In addition to its functional significance, the ventricular septum also serves as a structural barrier between the atria and ventricles. This separation helps prevent backflow of blood into the atria during diastole, ensuring that the heart pumps blood efficiently throughout the cardiac cycle. The ventricular septum has several important consequences for cardiovascular health. Abnormalities in its structure or function can lead to conditions such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), a common congenital heart disease characterized by an opening in the septum, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which can occur due to the abnormal electrical activity caused by the septum's altered conduction properties. Understanding the complexities of the ventricular septum is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. Through advances in imaging techniques and cardiac catheterization, clinicians can accurately diagnose VSD"
M0501519,"Endocardial cushions, also known as truncus arteriosus, are complex structures formed during cardiac development from midline fusions of ectodermal tissue. During gastrulation, the developing embryo undergoes a series of morphogenetic movements that result in the formation of three primary heart fields: the sinusoidal field, the atrioventricular (AV) field, and the splanchnic/midline field. The AV field is comprised of the left and right atria and ventricles, while the splanchnic/midline field gives rise to the truncus arteriosus. The endocardial cushions are a critical component of this formation process. They arise from the surface ectoderm at multiple sites along the midline, including the AV canals (also known as atrioventricular canals or AV canals), where they eventually fuse to form these critical structures. The AV canals are crucial for the development and function of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, which separate the right and left atria from the right ventricle. During fetal development, the AV canals undergo significant morphogenetic changes that result in the formation of the valve leaflets, annuli, and other structures necessary for proper cardiac function. The truncus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormality in the formation of the endocardial cushions during embryonic development. As a result, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are absent or severely underdeveloped, leading to cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, and other complications. In adult life, individuals with truncus arteriosus often experience severe cardiac dysfunction due to the absence or significant underdevelopment of these critical structures. Surgical interventions, such as the Fontan procedure, may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life in affected individuals."
