M0009975,Heart Ventricles The lower right and left chambers of the heart. The right ventricle pumps venous BLOOD into the LUNGS and the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the systemic arterial circulation.
M0013957,"Mitral Valvealso known as Mitral Valves; Valve, Mitral; Valves, Mitral The valve between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart."
M0014344,"Myocardium The muscle tissue of the HEART. It is composed of striated, involuntary muscle cells (MYOCYTES, CARDIAC) connected to form the contractile pump to generate blood flow."
M0014351,Myofibrilsalso known as Myofibril The long cylindrical contractile organelles of STRIATED MUSCLE cells composed of ACTIN FILAMENTS; MYOSIN filaments; and other proteins organized in arrays of repeating units called SARCOMERES .
M0015833,"Papillary Musclesalso known as Muscle, Papillary; Muscles, Papillary; Papillary Muscle Conical muscular projections from the walls of the cardiac ventricles, attached to the cusps of the atrioventricular valves by the chordae tendineae."
M0016307,"Pericardium A conical fibro-serous sac surrounding the HEART and the roots of the great vessels (AORTA; VENAE CAVAE; PULMONARY ARTERY). Pericardium consists of two sacs: the outer fibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium. The latter consists of an outer parietal layer facing the fibrous pericardium, and an inner visceral layer (epicardium) resting next to the heart, and a pericardial cavity between these two layers."
M0018141,Pulmonary Valve A valve situated at the entrance to the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle.
M0018172,Purkinje Fibers Modified cardiac muscle fibers composing the terminal portion of the heart conduction system.
M0019441,"Sarcomeres The repeating contractile units of the MYOFIBRIL, delimited by Z bands along its length."
M0019898,"Sinoatrial Nodealso known as Node, Sinoatrial; Nodes, Sinoatrial; Sinoatrial Nodes The small mass of modified cardiac muscle fibers located at the junction of the superior vena cava (VENA CAVA, SUPERIOR) and right atrium. Contraction impulses probably start in this node, spread over the atrium (HEART ATRIUM) and are then transmitted by the atrioventricular bundle (BUNDLE OF HIS) to the ventricle (HEART VENTRICLE)."
M0021947,"Tricuspid Valvealso known as Tricuspid Valves; Valve, Tricuspid; Valves, Tricuspid The valve consisting of three cusps situated between the right atrium and right ventricle of the heart."
