UBERON_0000002,"The uterine cervix, also known as cervical canal of uterus, caudal segment of uterus, cervix uteri, neck of uterus, and lower narrow portion of the uterus, is a critical anatomical structure that connects the upper end of the vagina to the cervix of the uterus. Located at the junction between the upper and lower portions of the uterus, the uterine cervix serves as a passageway for menstrual blood and other fluids to escape from the female reproductive system. The cervix uteri is a narrow, muscular tube that extends from the top of the uterus to the lower end of the vagina. The caudal segment of the uterine cervix is the distal (lower) portion of this structure, which is characterized by a thickening of the mucosal and muscular layers. This region is also known as the cervical canal, and it plays a crucial role in the initiation of labor during pregnancy. In terms of embryological development, the uterine cervix forms from the fusion of the endodermal cells of the upper portion of the yolk sac and the ectodermal cells of the genital ridge. This process occurs around 4-6 weeks post-fertilization, marking the beginning of the formation of the embryonic gut. As development progresses, the uterine cervix undergoes significant morphological changes, including the differentiation of smooth muscle fibers, the formation of glandular tissue, and the development of a connective tissue framework. These processes ultimately give rise to the adult cervical canal, which is characterized by its muscular tone, striated muscle fibers, and mucosal lining. Anatomically, the uterine cervix is typically described as being composed of three layers: the muscularis externa, myenteric plexus, and submucosa. The muscularis externa layer surrounds the cervical canal, while the my"
