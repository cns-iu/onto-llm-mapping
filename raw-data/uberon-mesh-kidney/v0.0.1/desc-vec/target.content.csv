M0009299,"Glomerular Mesangiumalso known as Glomerular Mesangiums; Mesangiums, Glomerular The thin membranous structure supporting the adjoining glomerular capillaries. It is composed of GLOMERULAR MESANGIAL CELLS and their EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX."
M0011890,"Juxtaglomerular Apparatusalso known as Apparatus, Juxtaglomerular A complex of cells consisting of juxtaglomerular cells, extraglomerular mesangium lacis cells, the macula densa of the distal convoluted tubule, and granular epithelial peripolar cells. Juxtaglomerular cells are modified SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS found in the walls of afferent glomerular arterioles and sometimes the efferent arterioles. Extraglomerular mesangium lacis cells are located in the angle between the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles. Granular epithelial peripolar cells are located at the angle of reflection of the parietal to visceral angle of the renal corpuscle."
M0012006,Kidney Body organ that filters blood for the secretion of URINE and that regulates ion concentrations.
M0012010,"Kidney Calicesalso known as Calice, Kidney; Calices, Kidney; Kidney Calice Recesses of the kidney pelvis which divides into two wide, cup-shaped major renal calices, with each major calix subdivided into 7 to 14 minor calices. Urine empties into a minor calix from collecting tubules, then passes through the major calix, renal pelvis, and ureter to enter the urinary bladder. (From Moore, Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 3d ed, p211)"
M0012012,"Kidney Cortexalso known as Cortex, Kidney The outer zone of the KIDNEY, beneath the capsule, consisting of KIDNEY GLOMERULUS; KIDNEY TUBULES, DISTAL; and KIDNEY TUBULES, PROXIMAL."
M0012018,"Kidney Glomerulusalso known as Glomerulus, Kidney A cluster of convoluted capillaries beginning at each nephric tubule in the kidney and held together by connective tissue."
M0012019,"Kidney Medullaalso known as Kidney Medullas; Medulla, Kidney; Medullas, Kidney The internal portion of the kidney, consisting of striated conical masses, the renal pyramids, whose bases are adjacent to the cortex and whose apices form prominent papillae projecting into the lumen of the minor calyces."
M0012023,"Kidney Pelvisalso known as Pelvis, Kidney The flattened, funnel-shaped expansion connecting the URETER to the KIDNEY CALICES."
M0012025,"Kidney Tubulesalso known as Kidney Tubule; Tubule, Kidney; Tubules, Kidney Long convoluted tubules in the nephrons. They collect filtrate from blood passing through the KIDNEY GLOMERULUS and process this filtrate into URINE. Each renal tubule consists of a BOWMAN CAPSULE; PROXIMAL KIDNEY TUBULE; LOOP OF HENLE; DISTAL KIDNEY TUBULE; and KIDNEY COLLECTING DUCT leading to the central cavity of the kidney (KIDNEY PELVIS) that connects to the URETER."
M0012026,"Kidney Tubules, Collecting Straight tubes commencing in the radiate part of the kidney cortex where they receive the curved ends of the distal convoluted tubules. In the medulla the collecting tubules of each pyramid converge to join a central tube (duct of Bellini) which opens on the summit of the papilla."
M0012027,"Kidney Tubules, Distalalso known as Distal Kidney Tubules; Kidney Tubule, Distal; Tubule, Distal Kidney; Tubules, Distal Kidney The portion of renal tubule that begins from the enlarged segment of the ascending limb of the LOOP OF HENLE. It reenters the KIDNEY CORTEX and forms the convoluted segments of the distal tubule."
M0012028,"Kidney Tubules, Proximalalso known as Kidney Tubule, Proximal; Proximal Kidney Tubules; Tubule, Proximal Kidney; Tubules, Proximal Kidney The renal tubule portion that extends from the BOWMAN CAPSULE in the KIDNEY CORTEX into the KIDNEY MEDULLA. The proximal tubule consists of a convoluted proximal segment in the cortex, and a distal straight segment descending into the medulla where it forms the U-shaped LOOP OF HENLE."
M0012691,"Loop of Henlealso known as Henle Loop The U-shaped portion of the renal tubule in the KIDNEY MEDULLA, consisting of a descending limb and an ascending limb. It is situated between the PROXIMAL KIDNEY TUBULE and the DISTAL KIDNEY TUBULE."
M0014633,"Nephronsalso known as Nephron The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule."
M0473246,"Podocytesalso known as Podocyte Highly differentiated epithelial cells of the visceral layer of BOWMAN CAPSULE of the KIDNEY. They are composed of a cell body with major CELL SURFACE EXTENSIONS and secondary fingerlike extensions called pedicels. They enwrap the KIDNEY GLOMERULUS capillaries with their cell surface extensions forming a filtration structure. The pedicels of neighboring podocytes interdigitate with each other leaving between them filtration slits that are bridged by an extracellular structure impermeable to large macromolecules called the slit diaphragm, and provide the last barrier to protein loss in the KIDNEY."
M0475586,"Bowman Capsulealso known as Capsule, Bowman A double-walled epithelial capsule that is the bulbous closed proximal end of the kidney tubular system. It surrounds the cluster of convoluted capillaries of KIDNEY GLOMERULUS and is continuous with the convoluted PROXIMAL KIDNEY TUBULE."
M0475996,"Mesangial Cellsalso known as Cell, Mesangial; Cells, Mesangial; Mesangial Cell Smooth muscle-like cells adhering to the wall of the small blood vessels of the KIDNEY at the glomerulus and along the vascular pole of the glomerulus in the JUXTAGLOMERULAR APPARATUS. They are myofibroblasts with contractile and phagocytic properties. These cells and their MESANGIAL EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX constitute the GLOMERULAR MESANGIUM."
M0476074,"Glomerular Basement Membranealso known as Basement Membrane, Glomerular; Basement Membranes, Glomerular; Glomerular Basement Membranes; Membrane, Glomerular Basement; Membranes, Glomerular Basement The layer of EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX that lies between the ENDOTHELIUM of the glomerular capillaries and the PODOCYTES of the inner or visceral layer of the BOWMAN CAPSULE. It is the product of these two cell types. It acts as a physical barrier and an ion-selective filter."
M0555122,"Glomerular Filtration Barrieralso known as Barrier, Glomerular Filtration; Barriers, Glomerular Filtration; Filtration Barrier, Glomerular; Filtration Barriers, Glomerular; Glomerular Filtration Barriers A specialized barrier in the kidney, consisting of the fenestrated CAPILLARY ENDOTHELIUM; GLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE; and glomerular epithelium (PODOCYTES). The barrier prevents the filtration of PLASMA PROTEINS."
