UBERON_0001113,"The hepatic lobe, also known as lobus hepatis, is a critical anatomical structure within the liver. In traditional gross anatomy, it was divided into four lobes based on surface features: left anatomical lobe and right anatomical lobe. The falciform ligament, a fibrous band that attaches the liver to the diaphragm, plays a crucial role in dividing the liver into these two lobes. The left anatomical lobe is characterized by its larger size and more prominent vascular supply compared to the right lobe. It receives oxygenated blood from the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein branches, which carry deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract and small intestine. In contrast, the right anatomical lobe is smaller and has a more irregular surface anatomy, with fewer vascular branches. It receives venous blood from the inferior vena cava and splenic vein, as well as some branch from the hepatic artery. The right lobe also contains a significant portion of the liver's biliary system, including the common bile duct. The falciform ligament is located at the anterior (front) aspect of the liver, separating the left anatomical lobe from the right lobe. It plays a key role in maintaining the liver's shape and facilitating liver function. The falciform ligament also contains lymphatic vessels that drain blood from the liver into the bloodstream. In addition to its functional significance, the hepatic lobe is also of interest in forensic pathology due to its location and accessibility for examination during autopsies. Understanding the anatomy of the hepatic lobe can provide valuable insights into human pathophysiology and disease mechanisms, particularly in the context of liver disorders such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The concept of the hepatic lobe has been refined by advances in imaging technologies, including CT scans and MRI, which have enabled"
UBERON_0001114,"The right lobe of the liver, also known as the lobus hepaticus dexter or right liver lobe, is a significant anatomical structure located on the right side of the abdominal cavity. It occupies the right hypochondrium, a region in front of the diaphragm that separates it from the left. The falciform ligament separates it from the left lobe on its upper surface, and the left sagittal fossa marks its posterior surfaces with two smaller lobes: the quadrate and caudate. The right liver lobe is approximately six times larger than the left, with a proportion of 6:1. Its upper surface is separated from that of the left by three fossæ: the porta hepatis (gall-bladder region), the porta hepatica (further dividing into the superior and inferior vena cava regions), and the caudate lobe. The right liver lobe is also notable for having a distinct anatomical boundary between its upper and lower parts. The upper part, located near the gallbladder and inferior vena cava, is divided by three fossæ: porta hepatis, porta hepatica, and caudate lobe. The falciform ligament further divides the right liver lobe into two smaller lobes: the quadrate lobe and caudate lobe. The quadrate lobe is located on the lower border of the falciform ligament, while the caudate lobe extends posteriorly, marking the boundary between the right and left lobes. The falciform ligament also separates the right liver lobe from the inferior vena cava (IVC), which runs along its upper surface. The IVC divides into two branches: superior and inferior vena cava."
UBERON_0001115,"The left lobe of the liver, also known as the lobus hepaticus sinister, is a distinct anatomical structure that differs from the right lobe in several respects. It is smaller and more flattened than its counterpart, situated primarily in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Radiologically, the left lobe is characterized by a relatively flat upper surface, which is concave towards the diaphragm. This unique morphology is accompanied by an under-surface known as the gastric impression, where the stomach forms a distinct recess. In contrast to the more prominent right lobe, the left lobe's under-surface lacks the characteristic omental tuberosity, also referred to as the gallbladder fossa. Anatomically, the left lobe is bounded by the left anterior and left posterior hepatic veins, which converge to form a single vessel. The liver itself is defined by its three distinct lobes: right, left, and caudate. The caudate lobe is a smaller, more rounded structure located near the inferior vena cava, while the right lobe is typically larger and situated in the epigastrium. The liver's dual anatomy allows for specialized functions to be performed by distinct regions. The left lobe, in particular, is involved in the storage and secretion of bile, which plays a crucial role in digestion and nutrient absorption. The unique morphological features of the left lobe contribute to its specialized function, making it an essential component of liver physiology. In addition to its functional significance, the left lobe has been the subject of extensive anatomical study due to its distinct morphology and role in liver pathology. Researchers have used various techniques, including MRI and CT scans, to investigate the left lobe's structure and function, shedding light on its contributions to overall liver health. Overall, the left lobe of the liver is a"
UBERON_0001116,"The quadrate lobe, also known as liver quadrate lobe or lobus quadratus hepatis, is a specific anatomical subdivision of the right lobe of the liver. Situated under the surface of this lobe, it is bounded anteriorly by the anterior margin of the liver, posteriorly by the porta hepatis, to the right by the fossa for the gall-bladder, and to the left by the fossa for the umbilical vein. The quadrate lobe exhibits an oblong shape, with its antero-posterior diameter being greater than its transverse diameter. This characteristic is attributed to its unique morphological features, which distinguish it from other liver lobes. The boundaries of the quadrate lobe are defined by several anatomical landmarks: the anterior surface of the liver forms a curved line that demarcates the inferior border of the lobe; the porta hepatis, located at the junction of the right and middle hepatic ducts, marks the superior boundary; the gall-bladder fossa lies posteriorly to the lobe, dividing it from the left umbilical vein's entrance; and the liver's inferior surface confines the lobe to the right. As a specific variant of the quadrate lobe, another name has been used: the quadratus hepatis. This term is sometimes employed interchangeably with quadrate lobe, reflecting similar anatomical characteristics. In terms of histological structure, the quadrate lobe is composed of hepatocytes and other liver cell types, which are arranged in a specific pattern to ensure efficient metabolic processing and detoxification functions. The unique morphology and location of this lobe contribute to its specialized role in liver function, particularly in the regulation of bile flow and the metabolism of xenobiotics. The quadrate lobe's distinct anatomy makes it an important subject of study for researchers seeking to understand the complexities of liver morphology"
UBERON_0001117,"The caudate lobe of the liver is a small, triangular structure situated on the postero-superior surface of the right lobe. It is bounded by the physiological division of the liver on the left and the porta hepatis on the right. The ligamentum venosum separates the caudate process from the rest of the liver, while the fossa for the inferior vena cava and the ductus venosus define its anterior limits. The caudate process extends obliquely and laterally from the lower extremity of the caudate lobe to the undersurface of the right lobe. The caudate lobe is characterized by its vertical orientation, with a length that is significantly greater than its width. It is also concave in the transverse direction, giving it a distinctive shape. The liver's anatomy can be divided into eight segments based on the Couinaud classification system. In the case of Budd-Chiari syndrome, which involves occlusion of hepatic venous outflow, the caudate lobe can become hypertrophied due to its own caval anastomosis that allows for continued function. This process is known as compensatory hyperplasia and is a common occurrence in patients with this condition. The physiological division of the liver on the left side is bounded by the ligamentum venosum, while the porta hepatis on the right forms the inferior border. The fossa for the gall-bladder is located behind the caudate process, separating it from the commencement of the fossa for the inferior vena cava. In summary, the caudate lobe is a unique structure that plays a crucial role in liver function and can be affected by conditions such as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Its anatomy is characterized by its vertical orientation, concave shape, and distinctive borders, which distinguish it from other hep"
UBERON_0001143,"The hepatic vein, also known as the liver vein or vena hepatica, is a major blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the liver to the inferior vena cava (IVC). Located on the posterior surface of the liver, it ascends through the diaphragm and passes behind the stomach, spleen, and pancreas. The hepatic vein begins as a combination of right and left confluences, which merge to form the superior mesenteric vein. This secondary venous structure is then further divided into the portal vein, which enters the liver through the foramen of Winslow, and the hepatic portal system, which includes various tributaries that drain the gastrointestinal tract. The hepatic vein is approximately 10-12 cm in length, with a diameter of up to 2.5 mm at its distal end. It ascends through the inferior vena cava (IVC), passing behind the IVC and several accessory veins. The hepatic vein joins the IVC near the junction between the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein, creating a left-sided retroperitoneal vein. The hepatic vein receives blood from a variety of sources, including the stomach, pancreas, bile ducts, and gastrointestinal tract. It also drains blood from the liver itself, which is responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The hepatic vein plays a crucial role in maintaining proper blood flow to the kidneys, where waste products are filtered out. The hepatic vein's unique anatomy allows it to function as both an arterial and venous vessel. It receives oxygenated blood from the portal vein, which is rich in nutrients and energy for liver function. Conversely, it drains deoxygenated blood from the liver, which is then returned to the heart through the superior vena cava. The hepatic vein's fascial layer"
UBERON_0001149,"Area nuda hepatis, also known as bare area of liver, is a critical anatomical landmark in the liver that separates the hepatoduodenal ligament from the falciform ligament. The area nuda hepatis is a large, triangular surface of the liver devoid of peritoneal covering. This unique structure is formed by the fusion of the left and right lobes of the liver, which are separated by the caudate lobe. The hepatoduodenal ligament (HDL) is a fibrous band that connects the gallbladder to the liver via the cystic duct, while the falciform ligament is a thick sheet of peritoneum that attaches the liver to the anterior abdominal wall. The area nuda hepatis lies between these two structures, marking the transition from the hepatoduodenal ligament to the falciform ligament. The name ""bare"" refers to the fact that this region does not have any intervening peritoneal covering, unlike other areas of the liver that may be partially or fully covered by peritoneum. The area nuda hepatis is an important anatomical feature, as it allows for precise surgical dissection and manipulation of the liver during liver resections. The definition of Area Nuda HEPATI is rooted in histological analysis, which has revealed a distinct histological pattern characterized by the absence of perineural fibrosis and the presence of hepatocytes that are tightly packed together without any intercellular space. This unique arrangement of hepatocytes is a hallmark of the area nuda hepatis. The concept of Area Nuda HEPATI has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of liver surgery and transplantation. Understanding the anatomical landmarks of the liver is crucial for surgeons to perform complex procedures with precision and safety. In conclusion, the area nuda hepatis is a fascinating anatomical landmark that plays a"
UBERON_0001247,"Ligamentum falciforme hepatis, also known as falciform ligament, is a broad and thin antero-posterior peritoneal fold that attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. Its base is directed downward and backward, with an apex upward and backward, forming a remnant of the ventral mesentery of the fetus. Located in an antero-posterior plane but lying obliquely, this ligament faces forward on one surface and behind the right rectus and diaphragm, while facing backward on the other. It is attached to the under surface of the diaphragm by its left margin, as low down as the umbilicus, and extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver to the posterior surface. The ligamentum falciforme consists of two layers of peritoneum closely united together, with a base or free edge containing between its layers the round ligament and paraumbilical veins. Its base contains the hepatogastric ligament, which connects the liver to the stomach and the right ureter. The ligament is formed by the union of the left and right triangular ligaments, both of which are remnants of the ventral mesentery of the fetus. The triangular ligaments extend from their attachment points on either side of the midline, with their bases meeting at the umbilicus. Ligamentum falciforme plays a crucial role in liver function by providing support and facilitating the movement of visceral organs within the peritoneal cavity. It also helps to prevent excessive stretching or torsion of the liver, which could lead to complications such as hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. In pathological conditions, ligamentum falciforme can become inflamed or thickened due to liver disease or other causes. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, ascites, and var"
UBERON_0001279,"The portal triad, also known as the hepatic triad, is a fundamental multi-organ-part structure that plays a crucial role in liver physiology and function. Consisting of three vessels, this unique arrangement facilitates the exchange of nutrients, hormones, and waste products between the liver and other organs. The portal triad comprises: 1. The bile duct: A terminal branch of the hepatic artery, which transports bile from the liver to the small intestine for nutrient absorption. 2. The terminal branch of the hepatic artery: Supplies oxygenated blood to the liver tissue. 3. Portal vein: Carries deoxygenated blood rich in nutrients and hormones from the intestines and spleen to the liver. The portal triad is often referred to as the ""hepatic lobule"" due to its three-part structure, which allows for efficient exchange of substances. The bile duct, terminal branch of the hepatic artery, and portal vein create a complex network that enables the liver to filter, detoxify, and metabolize various substances. The portal triad is also known as the ""trias hepatica"" in Latin, where ""tri-"" refers to three, and ""-hepatica"" denotes the liver. This term was coined by ancient Greek physicians to describe this unique organ's role in processing nutrients and waste products. In addition to the bile duct, terminal branch of the hepatic artery, and portal vein, some variations may include a lymphatic vessel, which facilitates immune response and drainage of fluid. The portal triad is essential for maintaining liver function, as it enables: * Nutrient and hormone exchange with other organs * Waste removal and detoxification * Filteration and metabolism of substances Dysfunction or alteration in the portal triad has been linked to various liver disorders, including liver cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Understanding"
UBERON_0001280,"Liver parenchyma, also known as hepatic parenchyma or liver parenchyme, is the functional unit of the liver responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. It consists of a network of interconnected lobules, which are the basic structural and functional units of the liver. The liver parenchyma is composed of several layers of hepatocytes, the main cell type of the liver, which line the interior surface of the lobules. These cells are responsible for various metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism, detoxification, and cholesterol synthesis. The structure of the liver parenchyma can be divided into three layers: the basal plate, the central zone, and the apical plate. The basal plate consists of a single layer of hepatocytes that surround the portal tracts, which are narrow channels that connect the liver to the bloodstream. The portal tracts contain bile ducts, hepatic artery branches, and bile vessels. The central zone is a network of interconnected canals and sinuses that distribute blood flow and nutrient-rich fluid throughout the lobules. Hepatocytes in this region are responsible for producing bile and transporting it into the bile ducts. The apical plate consists of hepatocytes at the interface between the liver parenchyma and the bile ducts. The liver parenchyma is also home to various immune cells, including Kupffer cells and macrophages, which play a critical role in detoxification, inflammation, and immune response. Hepatocytes in this region are also involved in the synthesis of proteins, such as albumin, which are essential for maintaining blood pressure. The liver parenchyma is a dynamic organ that constantly adapts to changing metabolic demands and environmental stresses. Alterations in its structure and function can lead to various diseases, including liver cirrhosis, fibrosis, and cancer. In terms of ontological aspects, the"
UBERON_0001281,"Liver sinusoids, also known as hepatic sinusoids, are complex blood vessels with unique properties that facilitate the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and signaling molecules between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. They are characterized by their wide diameter (typically 10-30 μm) and high surface-to-volume ratio, allowing for efficient diffusion and perfusion of nutrients and gases. The sinusoids are formed by a network of branching capillaries that extend into the interstitial space surrounding hepatocytes. These capillaries are thin-walled and have a single layer of endothelial cells, which line them and regulate blood flow through the formation of tight junctions. The sinusoidal capillaries lack distinct venous or arterial markers, as they do not follow traditional veno-arterial circulation patterns. The liver sinusoids play a crucial role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis. They are involved in the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream, which is then transported into hepatocytes for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In addition, the sinusoids facilitate the exchange of amino acids, lipids, and other signaling molecules between hepatocytes and the liver microenvironment. The unique properties of liver sinusoids enable them to function as a specialized organ that can respond to changes in metabolic demand. For example, during fasting or low nutrient intake, the liver increases the size of the sinusoids through hypertrophy of endothelial cells, allowing for increased blood flow and glucose uptake. Conversely, when nutrients are abundant, the sinusoids shrink, reducing blood flow and glucose production. The study of liver sinusoids has implications for our understanding of tissue homeostasis, metabolic regulation, and disease mechanisms. The complex interactions between hepatocytes and the surrounding microenvironment are crucial for maintaining proper glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Research on liver sinusoids has also shed light on the role of non-canonical Wnt/"
UBERON_0001282,"The intralobular bile duct, also known as the canal of Herring or cholangiole, is a tubular structure located between the bile canaliculi and interlobular bile ducts near the outer edge of a classic liver lobule. This complex network plays a crucial role in the circulation and excretion of bile. The intralobular bile ducts are formed by the fusion of two or more bile ductules, which originate from the terminal bile ducts that empty into the common hepatic duct. The terminal bile ducts arise from the cystic duct and merge to form the common hepatic duct, which then joins the common bile duct. The intralobular bile ducts are approximately 100-150 μm in diameter and extend between the canaliculi and interlobular bile ducts, traversing the interstitial tissue of the liver lobule. They branch off into smaller ductules that eventually merge to form a larger terminal bile duct. Intralobular bile ducts serve multiple functions. They facilitate the transport of bile flow from the liver lobules to the hepatocytes and gallbladder. Additionally, they provide a pathway for the recirculation of bile stasis, which can occur when there is an obstruction or dysfunction in the extrahepatic bile ducts. The canal of Herring, also known as the cholangiole, is a specific type of intralobular bile duct characterized by its unique morphology and branching pattern. It has been studied extensively for its role in bile flow regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. In terms of ontogeny, the development of the liver lobules and interlobular bile ducts involves complex interactions between various cell types and tissues. The formation of intralobular bile ducts requires precise regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and"
UBERON_0002107,"The liver, also known as the hepatoma, is a vital exocrine organ that plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's homeostasis and overall health. Located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, it is attached to the diaphragm by a fibrous ligament. Physiological functions of the liver include secretion of bile into the small intestine, which aids in fat digestion and absorption, and metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and fat through the action of various enzymes and cofactors. The liver also synthesizes substances involved in blood clotting, such as prothrombin and factors V and IIa. Vitamin A synthesis is a critical function of the liver, particularly in the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol, which is essential for vision, immune function, and skin health. The liver's detoxification capabilities are also vital, as it plays a key role in removing toxic substances from the blood through various mechanisms, including conjugation reactions and renal excretion. In addition to its metabolic functions, the liver stores glycogen, a complex carbohydrate that serves as a primary energy reserve. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, which can then be utilized for energy production or stored in the form of glycogen. The liver also plays a role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte balance through various mechanisms, including the regulation of renin-angiotensin system and the release of aldosterone. Furthermore, it is involved in the synthesis and breakdown of lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides, which are essential for maintaining healthy cell membranes. Malfunctioning liver cells, or hepatocytes, can lead to various diseases, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). These conditions often result from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or other metabolic disorders that impair liver function"
UBERON_0004058,"The biliary ductule, also known as bile ductules or ductuli biliferi, is a fine terminal element of the bile duct system, leaving the portal canal and pursuing a course at the periphery of a lobule of the liver. It is an excretory duct that connects the interlobular ducts to the right or left hepatic duct. The biliary ductules are part of the bile duct system, which plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food we eat. The bile produced by the liver is transported to the gallbladder, where it is stored until it is needed for digestion. The biliary ductules then connect the liver lobules to the hepatic ducts, which are responsible for transporting bile throughout the body. The right and left hepatic ducts are connected to the biliary ductules, forming a common channel that allows bile to flow through both ducts. In advanced anatomy, the term ""ductuli biliferi"" is often used to describe the fine terminal elements of the bile duct system, including the biliary ductules. This term is derived from the Latin words ""duces,"" meaning ducts or tubes, and ""bilia,"" meaning bile. The biliary ductules are responsible for draining bile from the liver lobules into the hepatic ducts, where it is then transported to various parts of the body. The liver plays a vital role in removing toxins and waste products from the blood, and the biliary ductules play a critical role in this process. In pathology, the biliary ductules can be affected by various conditions, such as cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the bile ducts. This condition can cause bile to flow backward into the liver, leading to liver damage and dysfunction. Overall, the biliary ductules are an essential component of the bile"
UBERON_0004647,"The hepatic lobule, also referred to as hepatocyte radiating lobe or lobuli hepatici, is a complex polygonal structure that constitutes a significant portion of the liver's total area. This intricate organization serves as the fundamental unit for liver function and plays a crucial role in maintaining overall tissue health. Characterized by the presence of hepatocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells responsible for metabolizing nutrients, detoxifying substances, and producing bile, the hepatic lobule exhibits a radial arrangement surrounding a central hepatic vein. The hepatocytes themselves are organized into numerous elongated processes that converge to form the liver parenchyma. As the hepatocytes radiate outward from the hepatic vein, they give rise to distinct lobuli, which can be further subdivided into individual lobules or even smaller units known as hepatic acini. Each lobule is bounded by a marginal plate and has its own unique arrangement of hepatocytes, characterized by a specific pattern of branching and morphological specialization. The liver's parenchymal tissue is organized in a hierarchical manner, with the most superficial layer comprising flat hepatocytes that lie adjacent to the hepatic vein. As one moves deeper into the lobule, the cells become more specialized, exhibiting various degrees of differentiation, including increased lipid synthesis and glycogen storage capacities. The hepatic lobule's complex structure allows for efficient tissue perfusion and exchange, facilitating the delivery of nutrients and waste products between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. This intricate organization also enables the liver to respond to a wide range of stimuli, including changes in blood flow, metabolic state, and exogenous substances. Lobuli hepatici are often used as an indicator of liver health, with alterations in their size, shape, or cellular morphology suggestive of underlying pathologies, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The study of the hepatic lobule provides valuable insights"
UBERON_0005452,"The hepatic cord, also known as hepatic lamina or liver cell plate, is a three-dimensional arrangement formed by plates of hepatocytes that radiate from the center of the liver lobule. This complex structure is typically composed of numerous small, highly branched, and irregularly shaped plates, which are bordered by endothelial-lined vascular spaces called hepatic sinusoids. The hepatic cord serves as the fundamental framework for the organization and development of liver tissue, providing a structural foundation for the intricate network of blood vessels, bile ducts, and other supporting tissues. The arrangement of hepatocytes within the hepatic cord is highly dynamic, with individual cells exhibiting polarized growth patterns that drive the formation of lobules. The hepatic cord is often described as being composed of layers or laminae, which are characterized by their distinct branching morphology. These laminar structures are thought to be derived from the aggregation of individual hepatocytes, each of which contributes a single platelet to form the overall structure. In addition to its structural significance, the hepatic cord plays a crucial role in regulating liver function and metabolism. The presence and organization of the hepatic cord influence blood flow patterns within the liver, with changes in vascularization affecting the distribution of nutrients and waste products throughout the tissue. The concept of the hepatic cord has been applied to various aspects of liver development and disease pathology, including its role in congenital anomalies, alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis. Furthermore, advances in molecular biology have revealed that the hepatic cord is not merely a passive structural component, but rather an active regulatory mechanism that influences liver function and disease progression. The study of the hepatic cord has significant implications for understanding the complex interactions between tissue organization, vascularization, and metabolic regulation within the liver. By elucidating the mechanisms governing the formation and development of this critical structure, researchers can gain insights into the pathogenesis of various liver diseases"
UBERON_0006588,"The round ligament of the liver, also known as ligamentum teres hepatis, ligamentum teres hepatitis, or simply the ligamentum teres, is a degenerative string of tissue that exists in the free edge of the falciform ligament of the liver. This structure represents the remnant of the fetal left umbilical vein. Anatomically, the round ligament divides the left part of the liver into medial and lateral sections, separating them from each other by a fibrous layer of tissue. The ligament's origin is closely associated with the insertion of the left umbilical vein around the umbilicus, making it an important landmark on the anterior abdominal wall. The round ligament undergoes significant changes in development and histology. Prenatally, it is present as a patent left umbilical vein that connects the fetal liver to the placenta. However, shortly after birth, the umbilical vein degenerates into fibrous tissue, which eventually forms the round ligament. Histologically, the ligamentum teres consists of collagenous and reticular fibers, with a loose fibrillary matrix. The degenerative changes in the umbilical vein are characterized by the formation of fibrillar material, leading to the deposition of these fibers within the extracellular matrix. This process is accompanied by an increase in cell number and the accumulation of lipofuscin, which contributes to the ligament's fibrous nature. The structure and degenerative processes involved in the round ligament can be attributed to the evolutionary pressures that have shaped its development over millions of years. The retention of a remnant of the fetal umbilical vein, despite the loss of its functional connection to the placenta, suggests an adaptation for the maintenance of fetal circulation patterns in postnatal life. The round ligament serves as a critical structural component of the liver's anatomy"
UBERON_0006727,"The left lateral lobe of the liver is a segmental structure that comprises a portion of the inferior aspect of the lobulus hepatis sinister. This region is bounded by the caudate lobe anteriorly, the putamen anteriorly and superiorly, and the gallbladder fossa posteriorly. As a segmental entity, the left lateral lobe can be divided into distinct sub-segments, which are further subdivided into smaller lobules. The left lateral lobe is characterized by a unique architecture, with a central vein draining directly to the hepatic portal vein and a network of portal radicles that converge towards the junction of the common bile duct and the hepatopancreatic ampulla. The left lateral lobe is also distinguished by its association with key neural pathways, including the right anterior cingulate gyrus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior insula. The latter region has been implicated in various cognitive and emotional processes, such as empathy and self-referential thinking. From a functional perspective, the left lateral lobe plays a crucial role in modulating liver function, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and lipid metabolism. It also serves as an important site for the storage and release of various bioactive lipids, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. In terms of ontological classification, the left lateral lobe can be regarded as a variant of the hepatic segmental organization system, which is characterized by a network of interconnected segments that are organized around key neural pathways. The left lateral lobe can be further distinguished from other liver segments based on its distinct histological and molecular characteristics. The name ""lateral segment"" is a common alias for this region, reflecting its position in relation to the caudate lobe. However, it is worth noting that the term ""segmentum laterale"" (lobus hepatis sinister)"
UBERON_0006728,"The liver's left medial lobe, also known as medial segment of left lobe (MSLL), is a distinct anatomical region within the left liver lobe. This segment occupies approximately 25% of the liver's total volume and serves as a critical site for various physiological processes. Located on the left lateral surface of the liver, MSLL is bounded by the caudate lumen, the falciform ligament, and the inferior vena cava (IVC). The medial segment is further divided into two subregions: the caudate nucleus and the caudal portion. The caudate nucleus is a large, rounded mass of hepatocytes that connects to the falciform ligament via the foramen of Winslow. This structure plays a pivotal role in detoxification, including the processing and removal of toxins from the blood. The caudal portion of MSLL is characterized by a higher concentration of bile ducts, which facilitate the secretion of bile into the biliary tree. The medial segment of left lobe (MSLL) also contains a significant proportion of the liver's parenchyma, including hepatocytes and lobular capillaries. The interstitial tissue in this region is composed mainly of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, which contribute to the liver's mechanical function and collagen production. The MSLL is distinct from other anatomical regions due to its unique histological characteristics and functional specialization. For instance, the caudate nucleus exhibits a higher degree of cellular proliferation and differentiation compared to other liver segments, suggesting an important role in regeneration and response to injury. Mediastinal connections between the left medial lobe (MSLL) and the inferior vena cava (IVC) facilitate liver blood flow. The hepatic veins empty their blood into the IVC, which then drains into the systemic circulation. This unique anatomical arrangement enables MS"
UBERON_0006729,"The liver perisinusoidal space, also known as Disse's space, is a distinct extravascular compartment within the liver that separates the hepatocytes from the sinusoids. This narrow gap, typically measuring between 100 and 150 micrometers in diameter, contains a high concentration of microtubules and intermediate filaments, which provide structural support to the hepatocyte membranes. The perisinusoidal space is bounded by a single layer of flattened hepatocytes, with each cell forming a tight seal around the sinusoid. The space itself consists of a rich meshwork of blood vessels, including arterioles, venules, and sinusoids, which drain blood from the liver into the hepatic portal vein. The perisinusoidal space is characterized by a unique set of proteins and lipids that facilitate the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and immune cells between the hepatocytes and sinusoids. The space contains high levels of transcytoic proteins, such as claudins and occludin, which form tight junctions with the hepatocyte membranes to regulate passage of molecules across the epithelial barrier. The perisinusoidal space is also home to a diverse array of immune cells, including macrophages, Kupffer cells, and dendritic cells, which patrol the space to defend against pathogens and foreign substances. These cells interact with the microvilli on the hepatocytes, facilitating communication and exchange of information. Disse's space plays a critical role in maintaining liver function and homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of nutrient absorption, lipid metabolism, and the clearance of toxins and waste products. Alterations in Disse's space have been implicated in various liver diseases, including hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The perisinusoidal space is a complex organellar structure that requires precise regulation to maintain the delicate"
UBERON_0006841,"The central vein of the liver, also known as terminal branch of hepatic vein or vena centralis (hepar), is a vital structure that plays a crucial role in liver function. Located at the center of each lobule, this vein drains the hepatic parenchyma and directly connects to the hepatic artery, which supplies oxygenated blood. The central vein is a terminal branch of the inferior vena cava (IVC), which is a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body. The central vein's unique structure allows it to collect all the deoxygenated blood from the lobule and transport it to the liver for detoxification, metabolism, and excretion. The vein is approximately 1-2 mm in diameter and has a length of about 5-7 mm, which enables it to drain the entire lobule. The central vein receives its blood supply from multiple branches, including: * Hepatic artery: supplies oxygenated blood * Superior mesenteric vein: drains blood from the duodenum and proximal jejunum * Splenic vein: drains blood from the spleen As it flows into the inferior vena cava (IVC), the central vein joins forces with other hepatic veins to form the left atrium of the liver. The IVC, a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body, is also involved in draining the liver. The terminal branch of the central vein plays a critical role in maintaining liver function by facilitating the removal of waste products and excess substances from the liver tissue. This process is essential for overall health and prevents the buildup of toxins in the body. In conclusion, the central vein of the liver is a vital structure that regulates blood flow to the hepatic parenchyma and facilitates the removal of waste products through detoxification and excretion processes. Its unique anatomy"
UBERON_0011955,"The left hepatic vein is a significant anatomical structure within the liver, playing a crucial role in the circulatory system. It originates from the left lobe of the liver and extends posteriorly to drain bile into the inferior vena cava. Physiological characteristics of the left hepatic vein include: * The vein's primary function is to collect deoxygenated blood from the hepatocytes and transport it to the liver for detoxification, metabolism, and excretion. * The left hepatic vein receives a significant portion of the biliary drainage, including bile from the gallbladder and pancreatic ducts. * The vein's path follows the inferior vena cava, which allows for efficient drainage of the liver's contents into the systemic circulation. In terms of ontological relationships, the left hepatic vein can be considered as an example of a developmental structure, where it arises from the embryonic liver bud. Its formation is closely tied to the development of other liver structures, such as the left confluence foramen and the hepatic ducts. From an anatomical perspective, the left hepatic vein has several key features that distinguish it from its right counterpart. Notably, it lacks a confluence with the inferior vena cava, which characterizes the right hepatic vein. Instead, the left hepatic vein is in close proximity to the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein, indicating its unique role as a bile drainage pathway. The left hepatic vein's ontogeny has been extensively studied in the context of liver development and regeneration. Research has shown that the formation of this structure is closely tied to the activation of hepatic progenitor cells and the subsequent differentiation into functional hepatic cells. This process is thought to occur in response to injury or inflammation, allowing for the repair and regeneration of the liver. In conclusion, the left hepatic vein represents an important anatomical landmark that highlights"
UBERON_0011956,"The right hepatic vein is a vital structure within the liver, playing a crucial role in draining blood from the hepatocytes to the inferior vena cava via the portal vein. As part of the hepatic venous system, it serves as an alternative route for deoxygenated blood to escape the liver. Located within the right lobe of the liver, the right hepatic vein branches off into multiple segments, ultimately converging with the inferior vena cava to form a single vein. This fusion occurs due to the convergence of several smaller hepatic veins, which eventually join to form a larger vein. The right hepatic vein has two main parts: the segmental and the terminal. Segmental veins are smaller branches that originate from various locations within the liver and drain into the right hepatic vein. These segments are typically paired on either side of the midline, forming a symmetrical pattern. The terminal vein is the larger component, comprising multiple segments joined together. The right hepatic vein has distinct anatomical features, including the presence of the portal vein bifurcation, which occurs approximately 5 cm from the confluence of the inferior vena cava and the left hepatic vein. This bifurcation allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the liver and other organs. The right hepatic vein is also notable for its unique relationship with the gallbladder. During embryonic development, the portal vein divides into two main branches: the common bile duct (CBD) and the superior mesenteric vein. The CBD eventually gives rise to the left hepatic vein, while the superior mesenteric vein drains into the splenic vein, which in turn joins with the right hepatic vein. The name ""right hepatic vein"" is often used interchangeably with ""from the right lobe of liver,"" emphasizing its location within the liver's right lobe. In some contexts,"
UBERON_0011957,"The middle hepatic vein is a critical component of the hepatic venous system, playing a crucial role in the removal of blood from the liver. A key feature of the liver's venous drainage is the presence of multiple veins that converge to form a single main trunk. The middle hepatic vein is one such vessel, arising from the junction of the left and right anterior hepatic veins. The name ""middle"" in this context refers to its position in the hepatic venous system, which is characterized by a characteristic branching pattern. As the name suggests, the middle hepatic vein typically occupies the mid-lateral aspect of the liver, often situated near the inferior vena cava (IVC). From its origin, the middle hepatic vein drains approximately 70-80% of the liver's blood supply via a complex network of smaller tributaries. The main trunk then descends to the diaphragm and empties into the left renal vein. The middle hepatic vein is typically longer than other hepatic veins, with some specimens measuring up to 2 cm in length. Its luminal diameter varies, ranging from 1-4 mm. Regarding its anatomical relations, the middle hepatic vein often interacts with the portal venous system, particularly the left gastric and splenic veins. In some cases, it may be associated with the inferior phrenic vessels or the inferior vena cava. The functional significance of the middle hepatic vein is multifaceted. It facilitates the removal of toxic substances, such as bilirubin and bile pigments, which are then processed by the liver for excretion. Additionally, the middle hepatic vein plays a role in the development and maintenance of normal liver function, particularly during fetal development. The concept of middle hepatic veins has been extensively studied, with various studies investigating their anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. These investigations have shed"
UBERON_0013138,"The coronary ligament, also known as ligamentum corneum or ligamentum coronarium, is a fibrous structure that connects the liver to the diaphragm. This peritoneal reflection plays a crucial role in maintaining the liver's position and preventing its displacement. Anatomically, the coronary ligament is composed of two main parts: the dorsal part and the ventral part. The dorsal part originates from the free edge of the inferior surface of the liver's caudate lobe, running anteriorly to insert into the diaphragm at a location approximately 2-3 cm behind the crura diaphragma. The ventral part is located between the free edge of the liver's body and its caudal pole. It passes posteriorly to the inferior vena cava and the left kidney, inserting into the diaphragm near the crus of the diaphragm. The coronary ligament serves several purposes. Firstly, it helps maintain the liver's blood supply by providing a conduit for the hepatic portal vein and the right gastric vein. This prevents backflow of blood and maintains liver perfusion. Secondly, the ligament supports the liver in its position against the diaphragm, preventing dislocation or herniation. Its fibrous nature provides excellent tensile strength, allowing it to withstand various degrees of diaphragmatic movement. In addition, the coronary ligament is involved in the regulation of intrahepatic pressure. The portal hypertension caused by liver disease can lead to increased pressure within the hepatic sinusoids. The coronary ligament plays a role in preventing portal hypertension-induced liver injury by maintaining blood flow and reducing pressure within the liver. The coronarium also contains a number of important structures, including the falciform ligaments, the lesser omentum, and the hepatorenal ligaments. These structures are integral to the liver's structure and function, and their"
UBERON_0013139,"The hepatic ligament, also known as the ligament of liver, is a strong, fibrous structure that connects the right kidney to the liver via the inferior vena cava. It is a significant anatomical landmark, particularly in abdominal imaging and surgical procedures. Histologically, the hepatic ligament is composed of dense fascia that surrounds the inferior vena cava and the renal vessels. The extracellular matrix is characterized by high levels of collagen, with a predominance of type III collagen, which provides strength and elasticity to the tissue. Anatomically, the hepatic ligament is bounded by two layers: the peritoneum and the fascia latae. It runs from the right kidney, passing through the retroperitoneal space, and then curves anteriorly towards the liver, accompanying it as it ascends into the left hemiliver. The hepatic ligament serves as an attachment point for several key structures, including the inferior vena cava, the left renal vein, and the left suprarenal gland. Its posterior aspect is also in close proximity to the renal vessels, which are closely related to the ligament due to their shared origin from the left renal artery. In terms of embryology, the hepatic ligament is thought to have formed during the development of the mid-gut and left kidney regions. The anterior aspect of the ligament may have been influenced by the formation of the left renal diverticulum. Clinical significance arises when the hepatic ligament is disrupted or damaged, particularly in conditions such as splenorenal fistula, which can occur due to liver or kidney surgery. This can lead to complications including bleeding, infection, and tissue damage. Radiological imaging, such as CT scans, often depicts the hepatic ligament as a distinct structure, sometimes visualized by highlighting its fascial nature using specific contrast agents. In surgical procedures"
UBERON_0015481,"The left hepatic artery, also known as the left branch of hepatic artery, is a significant vascular structure that plays a crucial role in liver function and circulation. Anastomoses between the left and right hepatic arteries are present at the junction of the proper hepatic artery and the common hepatic duct. The left part of the hepatic artery proper arises from the proximal segment of the proper hepatic artery, which is one of the three main hepatic arteries that supply oxygenated blood to the liver. The left branch of hepatic artery bifurcates into two main branches: the middle hepatic artery and the left gastric artery. The middle hepatic artery gives rise to several smaller branches, including the right posterior inferior phrenic artery, the right anterior inferior phrenic artery, and the common bile duct (CBD) proper. The left gastric artery is a direct branch of the left part of the hepatic artery proper and supplies blood to the stomach. It descends along the lesser curvature of the stomach and divides into two branches: the left gastroepiploic artery and the right gastroepiploic artery. The left gastroepiploic artery innervates the greater curvature of the stomach, while the right gastroepiploic artery supplies the lesser curvature. The origin of the left gastric artery is also significant, as it typically arises from the anterior aspect of the proper hepatic artery. This anatomical relationship between the proper and common hepatic arteries facilitates blood flow to both the liver and the stomach. In addition to its role in supplying blood to the stomach and liver, the left branch of hepatic artery also plays a crucial part in maintaining bile ductal patency and drainage. The CBD proper, which arises from the left gastric artery, drains bile into the common bile duct, which then empties into the duodenum. The left hepatic artery is"
UBERON_0015482,"The right hepatic artery is a major blood vessel that originates from the celiac trunk, which itself branches off from the common hepatic artery. This unique arterial system plays a critical role in supplying oxygenated blood to the liver and other structures within the abdominal cavity. From its origin, the right hepatic artery ascends alongside the inferior vena cava, forming the right portal vein confluence with it. The right hepatic artery then divides into two main branches: the superior mesenteric artery proper and the right part of the left part of the hepatic artery proper (also known as the ramus dexter). The superior mesenteric artery proper is a major blood vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the small intestine, cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon. The right part of the hepatic artery proper, on the other hand, gives rise to several key structures. One of its primary functions is to supply deoxygenated blood from the liver and spleen to the superior mesenteric vein. Additionally, it contributes to the formation of the portal triad, a network of veins that facilitates the exchange of nutrients, hormones, and toxins between the liver and other abdominal organs. The right hepatic artery also gives rise to several smaller branches, including the right gastric artery, common hepatic artery proper, and the right part of the left part of the hepatic artery proper. These vessels further divide into various terminal branches that supply blood to specific structures within the abdomen. In terms of ontological classification, the right hepatic artery can be considered a part of the arterial system within the liver, which is comprised of several distinct vessels that work together to maintain vascular homeostasis and facilitate tissue perfusion. The right hepatic artery's unique role in supplying oxygenated blood to the liver and other structures underscores its significance in maintaining overall organ function."
UBERON_0015796,"The liver blood vessel, also known as hepatic portal vein or inferior vena cava, is a complex network of blood vessels that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood flow and oxygenation to the liver. From a biological perspective, the liver blood vessel is primarily composed of two main components: the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein. The hepatic artery arises from the aorta, specifically from the celiac trunk, and supplies oxygenated blood to the liver parenchyma (the functional unit of the liver). In contrast, the hepatic portal vein drains deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, pancreas, and other abdominal organs. The hepatic portal vein is a critical component of the hepatic venous drainage system, which facilitates the transport of nutrients, hormones, and waste products between the liver and the bloodstream. The veins that drain into the hepatic portal vein are typically dilated branches of larger vessels, such as the splenic vein or superior mesenteric vein. The liver blood vessel is also responsible for regulating blood pressure and flow through its muscular wall, which contains a high concentration of smooth muscle cells. These cells can contract and relax to adjust blood flow in response to changes in intrahepatic pressure and volume. In addition to its structural components, the liver blood vessel is influenced by various physiological and pathological factors, including cardiovascular homeostasis, nutrient uptake, and inflammation. For example, alterations in hepatic portal vein diameter or blood flow can impact liver function and glucose metabolism. The concept of the liver blood vessel has been extensively studied in the field of hepatology and circulatory physiology. Research has elucidated the mechanisms underlying its regulation, including the involvement of hormones such as insulin and glucagon, and the roles of various proteins like angiotensin II and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The study of liver blood vessels provides"
UBERON_0016478,"Hepatic stroma, also known as liver stroma, is a complex network of tissue that forms the structural and functional framework of the liver. It is a stroma that is part of the liver, comprising a dense aggregation of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers. Characterized by its unique arrangement of cell types, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and bile ductular epithelial cells, hepatic stroma provides the structural support necessary for liver function. The stroma is composed of two main components: the cytoplasmic matrix, which contains collagenous fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers, and the basement membrane, a thin layer of extracellular matrix that separates the cytoplasm from the hepatocytes. Hepatic stroma plays a crucial role in regulating liver function, including detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The stroma's unique composition allows it to secrete various factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which influence the behavior of surrounding cells. The epidermal layer of hepatic stroma is characterized by a rich network of capillaries, which facilitates nutrient and waste transport between hepatocytes and other liver cells. The basement membrane, in turn, provides mechanical support for hepatocytes and regulates their growth and differentiation. Hepatic stroma also plays a key role in the regulation of immune responses within the liver. Kupffer cells, resident macrophages located within the lumen of the bile ducts, are integral to the hepatic stroma's function, as they ingest foreign particles and microorganisms, while also secreting cytokines that modulate the surrounding stroma. In terms of its functional significance, hepatic stroma is essential for maintaining liver health and preventing disease. Alterations in hepatic stroma composition or structure have been linked to various liver diseases, including fibrosis, cirrhosis,"
UBERON_0016479,"The capsula fibrosa perivascularis, also known as collagenous capsule covering the external surface of the liver (Glisson's capsule), and hepatic capsule, refers to a complex structural entity surrounding the liver. It is a thin, fibrous layer that encompasses the liver parenchyma, forming an outermost boundary. The capsular tissue is composed of densely packed collagen fibers that are arranged in a network-like structure. The collagen matrix is reinforced by reticular fibers and elastin, providing mechanical stability to the capsule. The external surface of the liver is covered by this collagenous layer, which serves as a physical barrier between the liver and its surrounding environment. The capsular tissue also contains a range of cellular elements, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. These cells play important roles in maintaining the structural integrity of the capsule and participating in various physiological processes, such as detoxification and immune function. In terms of histological structure, the capsula fibrosa perivascularis exhibits a characteristic ""honeycomb"" or ""starry background"" pattern due to the presence of reticular fibers. The collagen fibers are oriented in a random fashion, giving rise to a network-like texture that allows for efficient distribution of mechanical forces. The capsular tissue is thought to be derived from embryonic mesenchyme and undergoes extensive remodeling throughout life, which can lead to changes in the size and shape of the liver. This process, known as hypertrophy or hyperplasia, is mediated by various cellular mechanisms, including cell proliferation, growth factor signaling, and autocrine/paracrine regulation. In some cases, the capsula fibrosa perivascularis may become thickened or fibrotic in response to pathological conditions, such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. This can lead to a range of consequences, including impaired liver function,"
UBERON_0035444,"The triangular ligament of liver, also known as the triangular ligament from the inferior vena cava, is a fibrous structure that connects the liver to the diaphragm and the anterior wall of the mediastinum. Anatomically, it forms a passageway between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the esophagus, allowing for the passage of blood flow from the IVC into the esophageal lumen. This structure is composed of dense connective tissue that provides support to the liver, facilitating its positioning within the pericardial cavity. The triangular ligament of liver is typically found in adults, although it may be more prominent or less defined in certain individuals, such as those with liver conditions or severe scarring. In some cases, this ligament may be absent or significantly reduced in size. From a functional perspective, its primary role is to regulate the pressure differential between the IVC and esophageal lumen, thereby influencing blood flow through the superior vena cava (SVC) and eventually into the heart. The ligament also provides structural support to the liver, helping to maintain its position within the pericardial cavity. The triangular ligament of liver is often associated with other structures, such as the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm or the left phrenic nerve. These anatomical landmarks are critical in surgical and radiological procedures that involve the upper abdominal region. In terms of pathology, abnormalities in the triangular ligament of liver can lead to conditions such as hepatic hematomas, vascular malformations, or even esophageal rupture. The structure's anatomy also makes it susceptible to injury during trauma or surgery. From a physiological and biomechanical perspective, understanding the triangular ligament of liver is essential for grasping the dynamics of blood flow through the thoracic cavity and the mechanics of liver positioning within"
UBERON_0039222,"The cystic artery, also known as cholecystic artery, is a crucial arterial supply that originates from the right hepatic artery. Its origin and course are closely related to those of the cystic duct. Anatomically, the cystic artery arises from the right hepatic artery, which is a terminal branch of the gastroduodenal artery. The right hepatic artery is itself a branch of the common hepatic artery, which in turn is a branch of the celiac trunk. The celiac trunk is a major arterial supply that branches off from the abdominal aorta at its level, just above the bifurcation into the left and right common iliac arteries. The cystic duct, on the other hand, is a small, muscular tube that connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct. It is an extension of the cystic artery, which initially arises from the cystic duct. The origin of the cystic artery from the cystic duct is a characteristic feature of this artery. As the cystic artery branches off from the right hepatic artery, it ascends along the cystic duct to reach its junction with the common bile duct. At this point, the cystic artery divides into two branches: one that supplies oxygenated blood to the gallbladder (the right branch) and another that drains the cystic duct into the main pancreatic duct. The cystic artery plays a vital role in supplying oxygenated blood to the cystic duct, which is then drained into the common bile duct. This process is essential for the proper functioning of the biliary system, as the cystic duct transports bile from the liver and gallbladder into the common bile duct for excretion. The cystic artery's origin from the right hepatic artery and its relationship with the cystic duct are well-documented anatomical features. In addition to its functional significance, understanding the anatomy of"
