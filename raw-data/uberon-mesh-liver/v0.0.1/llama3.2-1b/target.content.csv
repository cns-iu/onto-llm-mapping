M0002477,"Bile canaliculi, also known as bile capillaries, are minute intercellular channels that occur between liver cells and carry bile towards interlobar bile ducts. These structures are critical in the transport of bile from the hepatocytes to the gallbladder and ultimately into the small intestine for digestion. Located within the liver lobules, bile canaliculi are approximately 100-150 micrometers in length and have a diameter of around 10-20 micrometers. They consist of two or three interconnecting ducts that communicate with each other, forming a complex network. The walls of these channels are composed of hepatocytes, which are specialized liver cells responsible for the production and secretion of bile. The bile produced by the hepatocytes flows through the canaliculi into the interlobar bile ducts, which connect to the gallbladder. From there, it is absorbed back into the bloodstream and transported towards the intestines via the portal vein. The reabsorbed bile is then concentrated in the ileum before being eliminated from the body. Bile canaliculi play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating the concentration of bile salts, which are essential for fat digestion. They also facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the liver and other organs. The complex structure and function of bile canaliculi make them an ideal model system for studying liver physiology and pathophysiology. Bile canaliculi have several morphological characteristics that distinguish them from other types of capillaries. Their narrow diameter, high permeability, and unique composition of hepatocytes set them apart from other cell types. The presence of tight junctions between adjacent cells also contributes to the resistance of bile canaliculi to backflow. In addition, research has shown that bile canaliculi are dynamic structures that undergo changes in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli. For example, studies have"
M0002483,"Bile ducts, intrahepatic refer to the passageways within the liver that convey bile for its transport and excretion functions. These ducts are responsible for collecting bile from the gallbladder and transporting it to the duodenum through a network of intrahepatic ducts. The right and left hepatic ducts, in addition to their convergence outside the liver to form the common hepatic duct, also play a crucial role in the intrahepatic bile duct system. The hepatoduodenal ligament, a fibrous remnant of the embryonic foregut, serves as an attachment site for these ducts and helps to anchor them within the liver parenchyma. The intrahepatic bile ducts are further divided into two main sections: the right hepatic duct and the left hepatic duct. Each section bifurcates to form the right and left confluence hepatis, respectively, which ultimately drains into the common hepatic duct. The common hepatic duct then joins with the cystic duct to form the common bile duct. The intrahepatic bile ducts are lined by a single layer of hepatocytes and other supporting cells, including Kupffer cells, that play a role in the secretion and absorption of bilirubin and bile pigments. The ducts are surrounded by fibrous connective tissue and are supported by a dense network of pericytes, which help to regulate blood flow and maintain ductal patency. The intrahepatic bile duct system is composed of several key structures, including the hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, Peyer's patches (in the duodenal wall), and lymphoid follicles. These structures interact with each other to facilitate the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and pathogens between the gut and liver. The intrahepatic bile ducts are subject to various pathological conditions, such as"
M000606073,"The round ligament of liver is a fibromuscular cord-like structure formed from the closure of the left fetal umbilical vein. As a remnant of the left umbilical vein, this structure originates from the obliterated left portal vein near its junction with the hepatic artery. During embryonic development, the left umbilical vein ascends through the falciform ligament to fuse with the superior mesenteric vein and eventually gives rise to the right subfascial liver vein. The obliterated left umbilical vein then transforms into a fibromuscular cord that lies along the lower edge of the falciform ligament. This structure, also known as liver round ligaments or hepatic round ligaments from cord-like remnants (HRC), is a remnant of the left portal vein and serves as a fibrous sling around the liver. The HRC is composed of collagenous and elastic fibers, which provide tensile support to the liver. Its structure is characterized by a dense network of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells that have transformed into contractile myofibroblasts. In adults, the HRC is usually absent or reduced in size, but it can be reactivated in cases of pregnancy or liver injury. The presence of the HRC has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including liver regeneration, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The HRC has also been implicated in the development of liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is thought to contribute to tumor growth and invasion through its role as a tumor-associated structure. The exact mechanism by which the HRC influences HCC development remains unclear, but it is believed to interact with various signaling pathways involved in tumor progression. In conclusion, the round ligament of liver is an important anatomical structure that has been the subject of significant research in the fields"
M0012632,"Liver Function: A Metabolic and Detoxification Organ The liver, also known as the from, is a large lobed glandular organ located in the upper right abdomen of vertebrates. It plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and regulating various physiological processes. Primary Functions: 1. **Detoxification**: The liver filters toxins and metabolic byproducts from the bloodstream, removing them from the body through bile production and excretion. 2. **Metabolism**: The liver regulates the metabolism of nutrients, hormones, and other substances, converting them into energy or storing them for later use. 3. **Synthesis and Storage**: The liver produces various biologically active compounds, such as amino acids, sugars, and lipids, which are essential for growth and maintenance. 4. **Immune Function**: The liver plays a role in immune response, secreting cytokines and other signaling molecules to coordinate the body's defense against pathogens. Biological Processes: 1. **Hepatic Enzymes**: The liver produces enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions, such as glucose-6-phosphatase, which is essential for gluconeogenesis. 2. **Bile Production**: The liver produces bile, a digestive fluid that helps in the emulsification and absorption of fats and lipids. 3. **Pigment Metabolism**: The liver regulates the metabolism of various pigments, such as bilirubin, which is converted into urobilinogen for excretion. In conclusion, the liver is a vital organ that performs numerous critical functions essential for maintaining homeostasis and overall health. Its complex biochemical processes involve the coordination of various metabolic pathways, detoxification mechanisms, and immune responses. The liver's unique structure and function make it an integral part of the body's physiological machinery."
