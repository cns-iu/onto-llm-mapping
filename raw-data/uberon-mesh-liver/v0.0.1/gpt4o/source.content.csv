UBERON_0001113,"The liver, an essential organ in the human body, is traditionally divided into four lobes based on surface anatomical features, referred to as the hepatic lobes or liver lobes (lobus hepatis). These divisions are primarily the left anatomical lobe, the right anatomical lobe, the caudate lobe, and the quadrate lobe. The falciform ligament is a crucial anatomical structure on the anterior surface of the liver, which demarcates the left anatomical lobe and the right anatomical lobe. The right anatomical lobe is significantly larger than the left and includes the caudate and quadrate lobes, located on the visceral (posterior) surface of the liver. The caudate lobe is situated adjacent to the inferior vena cava whereas the quadrate lobe is located anteriorly near the gallbladder. Transitioning from traditional gross anatomy, the functional division of the liver into lobes pertains to further clinical and surgical significance. This modern segmentation is generally based on the distribution of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile ducts. Accordingly, the liver is divided into eight segments as per the Couinaud system, each serving as independent functional units. Additionally, the left and right hepatic ducts, hepatic arteries, and portal veins supply respective lobes, following which they collectively drain into the hepatic veins and ultimately empty into the inferior vena cava. The liver's dual blood supply, by the hepatic artery (oxygen-rich blood) and the portal vein (nutrient-rich blood from the digestive organs), emphasizes the complex vascular interplay essential for its metabolic, synthetic, and detoxifying roles. Histologically, the liver is composed of microscopic functional units known as hepatic lobules. Each lobule is hexagonal in shape and contains a central vein surrounded by hepatocytes arranged in plates. Radially oriented, these plates enable optimal contact with adjacent sinusoids, allowing for efficient nutrient, toxin, and waste exchange. The hepatic sinusoids, along with Kupffer cells situated within them, play critical roles in blood filtration and immune surveillance. Clinically, knowledge of the liver's lobular and segmental anatomy is crucial for surgical procedures such as hepatectomies, liver transplants, and the management of hepatic diseases. Developments in imaging techniques such as CT and MRI have further refined the ability to delineate hepatic lobes and segments, facilitating precision in diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. In summary, the 'lobe of liver,' or hepatic lobe, is a fundamental concept based on anatomical and functional distinctions critical for understanding liver structure, function, and associated clinical practices."
UBERON_0001114,"The right lobe of the liver, also known as the liver right lobe, lobus hepaticus dexter, or right liver lobe, constitutes the largest part of the liver, with a size ratio of approximately six to one compared to the left lobe. It predominantly occupies the right hypochondrium region of the abdomen. Anatomically, the right lobe is delineated from the left lobe superiorly by the falciform ligament, inferiorly and posteriorly by the left sagittal fossa, and anteriorly by the umbilical notch. Morphologically, the right lobe displays a somewhat quadrilateral shape. Its inferior and posterior aspects feature three distinct fossae: the porta hepatis, the fossa for the gallbladder, and the fossa for the inferior vena cava. These fossae play pivotal roles in dividing the left part of the right lobe into two smaller sub-lobes: the quadrate and the caudate lobes. The porta hepatis, situated centrally on the inferior surface, serves as the main gateway for the vascular and biliary inflow and outflow to and from the liver, housing the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile ducts. The gallbladder, a key organ in bile storage and digestion, nests within its respective fossa. The fossa for the inferior vena cava houses the major vein returning blood to the heart from the lower body. Functionally, the right lobe of the liver, like the rest of the liver, is essential for various physiological processes including detoxification, synthesis of critical plasma proteins, and metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. It also plays a significant role in the production and secretion of bile, essential for digestion, and the regulation of blood clotting mechanisms owing to its extensive role in synthesizing clotting factors. The liver's ability to regenerate following surgical resection or injury underpins its crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and metabolic equilibrium within the body. In summary, the right lobe of the liver, or liver right lobe, is integral to numerous vital biological functions and is distinguished by its substantial size, complex anatomical features, and its role in dividing the liver into functionally significant sub-lobes. It serves as a structural and functional cornerstone within the hepatic system, reflecting its importance in health and disease."
UBERON_0001115,"The left lobe of the liver, also known as the left liver lobe, liver left lobe, or lobus hepaticus sinister, is a smaller, more flattened subdivision of the liver compared to the right lobe. Anatomically positioned in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions of the abdomen, the left lobe plays a critical role in various hepatic functions. Its superior surface is slightly convex and conforms closely to the diaphragm, facilitating efficient respiratory and cardiovascular interactions. On its inferior surface, the left lobe exhibits distinct anatomical features such as the gastric impression and omental tuberosity. The gastric impression is a concave area where the liver abuts and fits against the stomach, marking a zone of close proximity and interaction between these two organs. This anatomical adaptation ensures optimal coordination and efficiency in digestive functions. The omental tuberosity is a protruding area that corresponds to the omentum, a fatty layer that supports the intestines and serves as a key component in the storage of fat deposits. Functionally, the left lobe of the liver is integral to multiple physiological processes, including detoxification of blood, protein synthesis, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. Its hepatocytes facilitate metabolism, glycogen storage, and hormone production and regulation. The left lobe also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of bile, which is essential for the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats. Vascularization of the left liver lobe is provided by branches of the hepatic artery and the portal vein, ensuring a constant and rich blood supply necessary for its metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification activities. Venous drainage occurs via the left hepatic vein, linking the liver’s metabolic waste outputs to the systemic circulation for excretion. The left lobe is clinically significant not only for its functional roles but also as a site prone to hepatic diseases such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and various forms of hepatitis. Diagnostic imaging and surgical interventions often specifically target the left lobe, given its smaller size and anatomical features that may uniquely affect pathology and treatment outcomes. In conclusion, the left lobe of the liver, or lobus hepaticus sinister, is a fundamental yet smaller component of the liver with distinctive anatomical and functional characteristics that contribute significantly to overall hepatic physiology and systemic health."
UBERON_0001116,"The quadrate lobe of the liver, also known as the liver quadrate lobe, lobus quadratus, or lobus quadratus hepatis, is a morphologically distinct region of the liver located on the under surface of the right lobe. It is demarcated anteriorly by the anterior margin of the liver, posteriorly by the porta hepatis (the transverse fissure that contains the hepatic artery, portal vein, bile ducts, and lymphatics), laterally on the right by the fossa for the gall-bladder (a depression accommodating the gall bladder), and medially on the left by the fossa for the umbilical vein (a remnant structure within the liver formerly carrying oxygenated blood from the placenta in fetal circulation). The quadrate lobe possesses an oblong shape, with its antero-posterior (front-to-back) diameter being greater than its transverse (side-to-side) diameter. This lobe is composed chiefly of hepatocytes organized into functional units known as lobules, which facilitate critical hepatic processes, including bile production and secretion, metabolic regulation, detoxification, and synthesis of plasma proteins. The location of the quadrate lobe near the porta hepatis makes it significant in medical procedures involving liver transplantation, hepatic surgeries, or diagnostic imaging, as the vascular and biliary structures within the porta hepatis are susceptible to injury or obstruction. Additionally, its proximity to the gallbladder and umbilical vein fossa implicates this lobe in hepatobiliary diseases, gallbladder disorders, and potential sites for the spread of intra-abdominal infections. The quadrate lobe is distinct from other lobes due to its unique anatomical position and its contributions to the functional divisions within the liver, making it a crucial area of interest in hepatic anatomy and pathology."
UBERON_0001117,"The caudate lobe of the liver, also known as Couinaud hepatic segment I, hepatovenous segment I, liver caudate lobe, lobus caudatus, lobus caudatus hepatis, pars posterior hepatis, posterior hepatic segment I, posterior liver, posterior part of liver, segment I of liver, segmentum hepatis I, Spiegelian lobe, or Spigel lobe, is anatomically situated on the postero-superior surface of the right lobe of the liver, aligned with the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae. This lobe is delineated by specific anatomical landmarks: anteriorly and inferiorly by the porta hepatis, laterally by the fossa for the inferior vena cava on its right, and medially by the ligamentum venosum on its left, which is a remnant of the ductus venosus in fetal circulation. This segment is distinguished by its unique anatomical and physiological attributes. It projects posteriorly in a nearly vertical orientation and is elongated in the superior-inferior direction relative to its width. The lobe exhibits a concave transverse surface, which adds to its distinct shape. Extending from the caudate lobe is the caudate process, a small, oblique elevation of hepatic tissue that bridges the lower end of the caudate lobe to the under surface of the right lobe. This process is located posterior to the porta hepatis and serves to separate the fossa for the gall-bladder from the initial part of the fossa for the inferior vena cava. The caudate lobe possesses a unique vascular supply, which grants it functional independence under certain pathological conditions. It has direct venous outflow via a caval anastomosis that maintains its drainage into the inferior vena cava independent of the hepatic veins. This attribute becomes particularly significant in Budd-Chiari syndrome, a condition characterized by the occlusion of the hepatic venous outflow. In such scenarios, the caudate lobe often undergoes hypertrophy as it compensates for the compromised hepatic circulation, leveraging its autonomous drainage pathway to sustain its function. Overall, the caudate lobe of the liver plays a crucial role in hepatic anatomy and function, with notable implications in hepatic pathology. Its anatomical and vasculature features make it a critical segment in both normal and diseased states of the liver."
UBERON_0001143,"The hepatic vein, also known as the liver vein, vein of liver, or vena hepatica, is an essential vascular structure responsible for draining deoxygenated blood from the liver and directing it towards the inferior vena cava. Typically, there are three main hepatic veins: the right, middle, and left hepatic veins, although there can be variations in their number and anatomy. These veins form a crucial part of the liver's vascular network, which includes the portal vein and hepatic artery for blood inflow. Hepatic veins emerge from the central veins located within the liver lobules, the functional units of the liver. These central veins collect blood from the liver sinusoids, where blood from both the portal vein and hepatic artery converge, facilitating the removal of toxins, metabolic waste products, and the processing of nutrients. The blood collected by the central veins is then channeled into the interlobular veins, eventually coalescing into the larger hepatic veins that exist on the superior surface of the liver. From a physiological perspective, the hepatic veins play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis by ensuring the continuous outflow of blood processed by the liver. This is critical for the regulation of systemic circulation and venous return to the heart. Given their location and function, hepatic veins are also susceptible to a variety of pathophysiological conditions such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, which involves thrombosis or obstruction of the hepatic veins, leading to liver congestion, hepatomegaly, and potentially severe hepatic dysfunction. Additionally, the hepatic veins have a significant anatomical and clinical role, particularly concerning liver surgery and transplantation. Accurate knowledge of hepatic venous anatomy is vital for surgical planning and the successful execution of hepatic resections, as well as for the placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) in patients with portal hypertension. In modern radiological assessment, hepatic veins can be visualized using various imaging modalities, including Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These modalities allow for the detailed evaluation of hepatic vein patency, flow characteristics, and anatomical variants, providing essential information for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Overall, the hepatic vein, with its variants such as liver vein, vein of liver, or vena hepatica, plays a critical role in hepatic and systemic physiology, with significant implications for both health and disease. Understanding its anatomy and function is fundamental in fields ranging from hepatology and surgery to radiology and pathology."
UBERON_0001149,"The bare area of the liver, also known as area nuda (hepar); area nuda hepatis; liver bare area, is a significant anatomical region characterized by the absence of peritoneal covering. This large, triangular surface is situated on the posterior aspect of the liver, particularly on its right lobe. The liver is predominantly enveloped by peritoneum, a serous membrane, which facilitates the slight movement of abdominal organs and provides a slippery surface to reduce friction. However, the bare area represents a deviation from this general anatomical feature. Anatomically, the bare area of the liver is bound by the coronary ligaments and the right triangular ligament. The coronary ligaments themselves form two layers—anterior and posterior—that converge at the right extremity to form the right triangular ligament. These peritoneal reflections demarcate the boundaries of the bare area, isolating it from the diaphragmatic surface while maintaining a firm attachment to the diaphragm. This attachment creates a zone where the liver maintains close contact with the diaphragm, facilitating vascular and lymphatic connections through the underlying connective tissue. The bare area is also clinically significant because it provides a route for the transmission of various pathological processes between the liver and diaphragm, including infections and malignancies. The liver parenchyma in this region is directly adjacent to the diaphragm without the intervening protective peritoneal layer, increasing susceptibility to such pathological conditions. Additionally, vascular structures such as the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins traverse this region, and several lymphatic vessels also course through the area nuda hepatis. These vessels play a crucial role in the lymphatic drainage of the liver, contributing to the overall fluid balance and immune functions within the organ. The absence of the peritoneal covering in the bare area facilitates easier passage of these structures. Understanding the precise anatomy and clinical implications of the bare area of the liver is essential for both anatomical education and clinical practice. Its unique anatomical features and potential as a site for the spread of disease underline its importance in hepatic and abdominal pathology."
UBERON_0001247,"The falciform ligament, also known as the falciform ligament of the liver or ligamentum falciforme hepatis, is a broad, thin peritoneal fold that attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. It retains a falciform shape with its base directed downward and backward, and its apex extending upward and backward. This ligament is a vestigial remnant of the ventral mesentery from the fetal period. It is oriented in an antero-posterior plane but lies obliquely, whereby one of its surfaces faces anteriorly, making contact with the peritoneum behind the right rectus muscle and the diaphragm, while the other surface faces posteriorly and is positioned against the left lobe of the liver. The left margin of the falciform ligament is attached to the undersurface of the diaphragm and to the posterior surface of the sheath of the right rectus abdominis muscle down to the level of the umbilicus. Its right margin spans from a notch in the anterior margin of the liver extending to the posterior hepatic surface. Structurally, the ligament is formed by the fusion of two layers of peritoneum. The free edge or base of the falciform ligament encloses the round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres hepatis) and the paraumbilical veins within its layers. The round ligament is the obliterated remnant of the fetal umbilical vein, and it extends from the umbilicus to the inferior surface of the liver. The paraumbilical veins, which run alongside or within the round ligament, provide a minor connection between the superficial veins of the anterior abdominal wall and the portal vein. In summary, the falciform ligament (ligamentum falciforme hepatis) plays a crucial structural role in anchoring the liver to the anterior body wall while containing important vascular remnants from fetal development, namely the round ligament and paraumbilical veins. Its unique positioning and dual-surface interaction with surrounding anatomical structures highlight its significance in maintaining hepatic stability and its adaptation from embryological origins."
UBERON_0001279,"The portal triad, also known as trias hepatica, is a multi-organ-part structure essential in hepatic function located within the liver's portal lobule. The triad comprises three primary vessels: the bile duct, a terminal branch of the hepatic artery, and a terminal branch of the portal vein. The bile duct is responsible for the conveyance of bile produced by hepatocytes toward the gallbladder and duodenum, facilitating lipid digestion and waste excretion. The terminal branch of the hepatic artery, which is a branch of the common hepatic artery, supplies oxygen-rich arterial blood to the liver, supporting its metabolic and detoxifying activities. The terminal branch of the portal vein, stemming from the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins, delivers nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to the liver. The portal vein predominantly carries metabolites and nutrients for processing and detoxification by hepatic parenchymal cells, contributing to systemic metabolic homeostasis. The juxtaposition of these vessels within the portal triad ensures a coordinated vascular supply, facilitating the dual-input blood flow necessary for the liver's complex functions. In addition to these three primary vessels, the portal triad may also include a lymphatic vessel, which is integral in maintaining interstitial fluid balance and immune surveillance by draining lymph from the hepatic tissues to local lymph nodes. The presence of the lymphatic component adds to the multifaceted nature of the portal triad in the context of fluid and immune homeostasis within the hepatic microenvironment. Each component of the portal triad is invested within a connective tissue sheath known as the Glisson's capsule, providing structural support and separation of the vessels as they traverse the periportal region of the liver lobules. The intimate association of these vessels within the portal triad underlies their critical interactions and collective contribution to liver physiology, including bile production, nutrient metabolism, and vascular regulation. Understanding the structural and functional dynamics of the portal triad is pivotal in elucidating hepatic pathophysiology and can provide insights into various hepatic diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatic fibrosis, where alterations in the portal triad architecture play a crucial role in disease progression. Thus, the portal triad, or trias hepatica, is a fundamental anatomical and functional unit within the liver, pivotal to its multifaceted roles in systemic physiology."
UBERON_0001280,"Liver parenchyma, also known as hepatic parenchyma, liver parenchyme, or parenchyma of liver, constitutes the functional units of the liver, predominantly organized into lobules. These lobules are hexagonal in shape and consist of hepatocytes, the primary cell type responsible for a multitude of metabolic, detoxifying, and synthetic activities. The liver lobules are delineated by a connective tissue scaffold and are pervaded by bile canaliculi, which facilitate bile secretion. Each lobule is centered around a central vein, which collects blood from the hepatocytes, ultimately converging into hepatic veins that empty into the inferior vena cava. At the periphery of the lobules lie the portal triads, which consist of branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. The portal vein supplies nutrient-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract, while the hepatic artery supplies oxygen-rich blood. This dual blood supply converges in the liver sinusoids, highly permeable capillaries lined with fenestrated endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages. The arrangement of hepatocytes in plates, one to two cells thick, permits maximum exposure to the sinusoidal blood for efficient exchange of substances. Hepatocytes synthesize and secrete essential proteins such as albumin and clotting factors, metabolize carbohydrates and lipids, and detoxify endogenous and exogenous compounds. They also store glycogen, vitamins, and other substances crucial for homeostasis. Bile produced by hepatocytes is conveyed through the bile canaliculi to bile ducts at the peripheries of the lobules and then stored and concentrated in the gallbladder or directly secreted into the intestine to aid in fat digestion and absorption. Thus, liver parenchyma profoundly contributes to maintaining the body's internal environment by performing vital biochemical functions. This functional architecture ensures that the liver efficiently manages its roles in metabolism, detoxification, protein synthesis, and secretion of bile, leveraging its cellular and vascular organization to maintain systemic equilibrium."
UBERON_0001281,"Hepatic sinusoids, also known as liver hepatic sinusoids, liver sinusoids, liver sinusoidal blood vessels, sinusoids of the liver, sinusoidal blood vessels of the liver, vas capillare sinusoideum, and vas sinusoideum, are unique vascular structures characterized by wide, thin-walled channels within the liver. These specialized blood vessels facilitate the exchange of substances between the blood and hepatic cells, playing a key role in the liver's multifaceted functions, including detoxification, metabolism, and synthesis of various plasma proteins. Structurally, hepatic sinusoids differ from conventional capillaries in their lack of a traditional basal lamina and their discontinuous, fenestrated endothelial lining, allowing for the passage of larger molecules and cells between the blood and hepatocytes. The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids are interspersed with Kupffer cells, resident macrophages that are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. These macrophages are essential for phagocytosing pathogens, apoptotic cells, and other particulate matter, thus contributing to immune surveillance within the liver. Hepatic sinusoids also lack the usual markers of arteries and veins, reflecting their dual input from the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The hepatic artery supplies oxygen-rich blood, while the portal vein delivers nutrient-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract. The mixing of these two blood sources within the sinusoids ensures that hepatocytes receive a balanced supply of both oxygen and nutrients necessary for their metabolic activities. The space of Disse, or perisinusoidal space, is located between the endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids and the hepatocytes. This anatomical arrangement allows the efficient exchange of metabolites, lipids, and plasma proteins between the blood and liver cells. Additionally, hepatic stellate cells reside within the space of Disse and play a critical role in liver fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix components in response to liver injury. The functional significance of hepatic sinusoids extends to their involvement in the filtration of blood-borne substances, biotransformation of drugs, and metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. By facilitating a close interaction between the circulatory system and hepatocytes, hepatic sinusoids crucially support the liver’s central role in maintaining systemic homeostasis. In summary, hepatic sinusoids are specialized, wide, thin-walled vascular channels in the liver characterized by a unique structure and function. They are critical in mediating the exchange of substances between the blood and liver cells, thus playing a pivotal role in diverse hepatic functions, from detoxification and metabolism to immune defense."
UBERON_0001282,"The intralobular bile duct, also known as the canal of Herring, cholangiole, or ductus interlobularis bilifer, refers to the small ductules within the liver that serve as a critical transitional conduit for bile between the bile canaliculi and the interlobular bile ducts. Located near the periphery of the classic liver lobule, these ductules are integral to the bile production and excretion process. The canals of Herring reside at the interface between hepatocytes (liver parenchymal cells) and cholangiocytes (bile duct epithelial cells), embodying a unique microenvironment that plays a vital role not only in bile transport but also in liver regeneration and repair. Structurally, the intralobular bile ducts consist of a monolayer of epithelial cells which vary in shape from cuboidal to columnar, depending on their location along the hepatic biliary network. These cells are involved in the modification of bile composition, contributing to the regulation of bile salt concentration and pH before bile enters the larger interlobular bile ducts and, subsequently, the extrahepatic biliary system. Moreover, the ductular cells possess key functional proteins and ion channels necessary for fluid and electrolyte transport, ensuring the proper flow and detoxification of bile. Functionally, the intralobular bile ducts are indispensable in liver homeostasis and pathology. These ductules are believed to host a subset of hepatic progenitor cells, often termed ""oval cells,"" which can differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, thereby participating in the liver's regenerative processes after injury. Additionally, pathologies such as cholestasis, primary biliary cholangitis, and various forms of hepatitis can significantly affect the integrity and functioning of the intralobular bile ducts, leading to a cascade of liver dysfunction. The canal of Herring's role in disease is also underscored by its involvement in the inflammatory response and fibrogenesis. Damage or obstruction of these ductules can result in bile acid accumulation within the liver parenchyma, promoting cellular damage and inflammation, which if persistent, can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Conversely, successful regeneration and repair of the canal of Herring are crucial for restoring normal liver function post-injury. In summary, the intralobular bile duct (canal of Herring, cholangiole, ductus interlobularis bilifer) is a key component of the hepatic biliary system, bridging bile canaliculi and interlobular ducts. Its significance extends beyond bile transport, encompassing essential roles in liver regeneration, homeostasis, and responses to hepatic injury and disease."
UBERON_0002107,"The liver, also known as the hepatobiliary organ or exocrine gland, is a vital organ with a multifaceted role in human physiology. It is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen beneath the diaphragm. As an exocrine gland, the liver secretes bile, which is essential for the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine. Beyond its exocrine functions, the liver is heavily involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. In carbohydrate metabolism, the liver maintains glucose homeostasis by storing glucose as glycogen (glycogenesis) and breaking it down (glycogenolysis) or producing it anew via gluconeogenesis. It also converts excess dietary carbohydrates into fatty acids and triglycerides, which are stored in adipose tissue. In terms of protein metabolism, the liver deaminates amino acids, producing ammonia that is subsequently converted into urea for excretion by the kidneys. Additionally, it synthesizes various plasma proteins such as albumin, globulins, and clotting factors, including fibrinogen and prothrombin, which are critical for blood clotting and maintaining osmotic balance in blood vessels. The liver's role in lipid metabolism includes the oxidation of fatty acids to produce energy, synthesis of lipoproteins, cholesterol, and phospholipids, and storage and hydrolysis of triglycerides. It also plays a key role in the synthesis of vitamin A from dietary carotenoids, which is crucial for vision, immune function, and cellular communication. Detoxification is another critical function of the liver. It converts potentially harmful substances such as drugs, alcohol, and metabolic byproducts into harmless molecules that can be excreted in bile or urine. The liver's Kupffer cells, specialized macrophages, also help in breaking down worn-out erythrocytes (red blood cells), recycling iron, and converting heme to bilirubin, which is then excreted in bile. The storage function of the liver is notable for its capacity to store glycogen, vitamins (A, D, E, K, and B12), and minerals such as iron and copper, releasing them as needed to maintain metabolic balance. In summary, the liver, also known as the hepatobiliary organ or exocrine gland, is essential for a myriad of biochemical processes including bile secretion, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, synthesis of clotting factors, vitamin A production, detoxification of harmful substances, and storage of glycogen, vitamins, and minerals. It is indispensable for physiological homeostasis and overall health."
UBERON_0004058,"The biliary ductule, also known as bile ductule or ductuli biliferi, represents one of the fine terminal elements of the bile duct system, originating from the portal canal and extending toward the periphery of a hepatic lobule. These ductules are integral components of the liver's excretory apparatus, establishing a linkage between hepatocytes and larger biliary ducts for bile conveyance. Anatomically, the biliary ductules emerge as the smallest conduits within the intrahepatic biliary tree, commencing where the bile canaliculi—microscopic channels formed by adjoining hepatocytes—coalesce. These fine structures subsequently merge to form bile ductules, which then converge into larger interlobular ducts located within the portal tracts. The interlobular ducts, characterized by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelium, further enlarge and divide into segmental ducts, ultimately discharging into the right or left hepatic ducts. Functionally, biliary ductules are essential for the transport of bile, a digestive fluid synthesized by hepatocytes. Bile facilitates the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats and the excretion of cholesterol, bilirubin, and various waste products. Within the ductules, bile fluid undergoes modification through the absorption and secretion of ions and water, orchestrating its final composition before entering the gallbladder or directly the duodenum via the common bile duct. Histologically, biliary ductules are lined by cholangiocytes—specialized epithelial cells notable for their absorptive and secretory capabilities. These cells exhibit tight junctions and adherens junctions crucial for maintaining ductal integrity and preventing the leakage of bile into the interstitial tissue. Additionally, the ductules are enveloped by a peribiliary capillary plexus, which supplies oxygen and nutrients, further bolstering their functional capacity. In pathological contexts, biliary ductules can be sites of significant disease manifestations. Conditions such as ductular reaction, chronic cholestasis, and primary biliary cholangitis underscore their clinical importance. Ductular reaction refers to the proliferation of ductules in response to hepatic injury and is a hallmark of various liver pathologies, including cirrhosis and hepatic fibrosis. Understanding the role and dynamics of biliary ductules thus holds substantial relevance for elucidating liver disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. In conclusion, biliary ductules, or bile ductules, constitute crucial anatomical and functional components of the liver's biliary system, mediating bile transport and playing significant roles in both health and disease."
UBERON_0004647,"The liver lobule, also known as the hepatic lobule, lobuli hepatici, or lobulus hepaticus, is the fundamental functional and structural unit of the liver, often depicted as a hexagonal or polygonal prism. Each lobule is composed of plates of hepatocytes, the liver's parenchymal cells, which extend radially from a central vein, also called the hepatic vein. These hepatocytes are arranged in cords or plates, separated by hepatic sinusoids—capillary-like vessels that facilitate the exchange of substances between the blood and liver cells. Each corner of the lobule is associated with a portal triad, or portal area, consisting of a branch of the hepatic artery, a branch of the portal vein, and a bile duct. The portal vein delivers nutrient-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract, while the hepatic artery provides oxygenated blood from the systemic circulation. The blood from these vessels flows through the sinusoids toward the central vein, giving rise to a mixing of oxygen-rich and nutrient-rich blood, which is vital for liver function, including metabolism, detoxification, and synthesis of plasma proteins. Hepatic sinusoids are lined with endothelial cells and a unique type of macrophage called Kupffer cells, which play a critical role in the liver's immune functions by engulfing pathogens and debris. The sinusoids drain into the central vein, which ultimately connects to the hepatic veins and subsequently to the inferior vena cava, allowing blood to exit the liver and return to the heart. The bile produced by hepatocytes is secreted into tiny bile canaliculi, which run between the hepatocyte plates. These canaliculi merge to form larger bile ducts located in the portal triads. Bile flow proceeds in the opposite direction of blood flow, moving toward the bile ducts in the portal triads and then to the biliary system for storage in the gallbladder or direct release into the duodenum. The liver lobule's architecture facilitates its multifaceted roles, including detoxification, biotransformation of various substances, production of bile, synthesis of clotting factors, storage of glycogen, and overall metabolic regulation. Understanding the structure and function of the liver lobule is crucial for comprehending various liver pathologies, including cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer, where lobular structure can be significantly altered."
UBERON_0005452,"The hepatic cord, also known as the hepatic lamina, lamina hepatica, liver cell plate, or hepatic laminae, is a three-dimensional arrangement of hepatocytes that forms the fundamental structural unit of the liver. Typically one cell thick, these plates of hepatocytes radiate from the central vein of the liver lobule. Hepatic laminae are highly branched, irregular structures that contribute to the liver’s complex architecture. Hepatocytes within these plates are parenchymal cells, responsible for various metabolic, detoxification, and synthetic functions crucial to homeostasis. Bordering the hepatic laminae are endothelial-lined vascular spaces known as hepatic sinusoids. These sinusoids are specialized capillary networks that facilitate efficient exchange of substances between the blood and the hepatocytes. The endothelium of hepatic sinusoids is fenestrated, lacking a basement membrane, thereby allowing direct access of plasma to the hepatocytes through the space of Disse. Furthermore, Kupffer cells, a type of hepatic macrophage, are embedded within the sinusoidal endothelium, playing vital roles in immune surveillance and phagocytosis of pathogens and debris. The arrangement of hepatocytes in the hepatic cords optimizes cellular interactions and metabolic processes. Their position ensures that each hepatocyte is in close proximity to both incoming blood from the portal vein and hepatic artery as well as outgoing bile produced by the liver. Blood entering the liver via the portal vein and hepatic artery percolates through the sinusoids, thus delivering nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to the hepatocytes while facilitating the removal of waste products and metabolites. The bile canaliculi, tiny ducts formed between adjacent hepatocytes within the laminae, collect bile produced by hepatocytes and convey it toward the bile ducts. This bile eventually drains into the gallbladder or directly into the small intestine, aiding in digestion and absorption of fats. In summary, hepatic cords or hepatic laminae, composed of hepatocytes arranged in a one-cell-thick, branched architecture, are integral to the liver’s function. Bordered by endothelial-lined sinusoids allowing for efficient substance exchange and facilitating the liver’s vast array of metabolic, detoxifying, and synthetic activities, the hepatic laminae underpin the liver's capability to maintain systemic homeostasis and perform critical physiological roles."
UBERON_0006588,"The round ligament of the liver, also known as ligamentum teres hepatis, ligamentum teres hepatitis, and ligamentum teres of the liver, is a fibrous cord-like structure situated within the free edge of the falciform ligament of the liver. This anatomical feature demarcates the left portion of the liver into its medial and lateral sections. The round ligament represents the remnant of the fetal left umbilical vein, a vital conduit during intrauterine development that facilitates nutrient and oxygen exchange between the mother and fetus. During fetal development, the left umbilical vein remains patent, allowing blood to flow from the placenta to the developing fetus. Following birth, this vein progressively collapses and ultimately degenerates into fibrous tissue, forming the round ligament. This transformation typically occurs within the first one to two months of postnatal life. The round ligament extends from the umbilicus to the inferior border of the liver, serving as a crucial anatomical landmark on the inner surface of the anterior abdominal wall. Notably, the round ligament of the liver is unique to mammals, underscoring the evolutionary significance of this structure in the context of placental and live birth reproductive strategies. This ligament is not only a critical marker for surgical procedures involving the liver and abdominal cavity, but also serves as an important reference point in imaging studies and anatomical dissections. The developmental progression from a functional umbilical vein to a fibrous remnant highlights the dynamic anatomical and physiological changes that characterize mammalian development. During the prenatal stage, the left umbilical vein is integral for fetal survival, providing a direct link to maternal circulation. Postnatally, as the circulatory system adapts to independent functionality, the redundant umbilical vein undergoes a process of obliteration, solidifying its role as the round ligament. In summary, the round ligament of the liver, or ligamentum teres hepatis, is a vestigial structure originating from the fetal left umbilical vein. Its transition from a patent vessel to fibrous tissue underscores the intricate changes that accompany mammalian development and highlights its utility as an anatomical landmark in both clinical and anatomical contexts."
UBERON_0006727,"The liver left lateral lobe, also known as the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver, lateral segment of the liver, or segmentum laterale (lobus hepatis sinister), represents a distinct anatomical and functional subunit of the liver. The liver itself is a vital, multifunctional organ involved in metabolic regulation, detoxification, protein synthesis, and bile production. Anatomically, the liver is divided into a right and a left lobe by the falciform ligament; the left lobe being further subdivided into medial and lateral segments. The left lateral lobe is situated more peripherally relative to the medial segment of the left lobe and is divided into segments II and III according to the Couinaud classification, which is widely accepted in hepatic surgery and radiology. Segment II corresponds to the superior portion of the left lateral lobe, whereas segment III encompasses the inferior portion. Both segments demonstrate intricate vascular and biliary branching patterns, often necessitating careful preoperative planning for surgical interventions, particularly in partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation. Histologically, the left lateral lobe, like other hepatic subunits, comprises hepatocytes organized into lobules, interspersed by sinusoids facilitating blood flow and nutrient exchange. The hepatic artery proper, portal vein, and hepatic veins provide the vascular supply and drainage, maintaining the organ's microenvironment and functional integrity. Bile produced in this segment is collected by intrahepatic bile ducts, ultimately contributing to the bile flow into the extrahepatic biliary tree. Functionally, the left lateral lobe participates in the liver's overall roles, including metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, detoxification of potentially harmful substances, and synthesis of coagulation factors. Its anatomical distinction is especially relevant in situations where localized liver disease or trauma affects specific segments, enabling targeted therapeutic strategies. Clinical imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilitate visualization and assessment of the left lateral lobe for diagnostic purposes. Conditions such as hepatic tumors, cysts, and cirrhosis can specifically alter the morphology and function of this segment, necessitating tailored medical or surgical approaches. Understanding the anatomical, histological, and functional aspects of the liver left lateral lobe provides critical insights for clinicians and researchers, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing surgical outcomes in hepatic treatment protocols."
UBERON_0006728,"The liver left medial lobe, also known as the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver, medial segment of liver, or segmentum mediale (lobus hepatis sinister), constitutes a specific anatomical and functional subdivision within the liver. Located in the left lobe, it plays a critical role in the hepatic architecture and the overall functionality of this vital organ. The liver, a key organ in metabolic processes, filtration, and detoxification, is divided into anatomical and functional segments, with the left medial lobe being an integral part of this segmentation. The medial segment of the left lobe (segment IV) is demarcated based on the portal vein's branching and includes the quadrate lobe. Anatomically, this segment is bounded by the falciform ligament on the right, which separates it from the left lateral segment (segment III), and on the left, it is contiguous with the left lateral extremity of the liver. Furthermore, the caudate lobe (segment I) lies posteriorly and superiorly to it. The functional significance of the liver left medial lobe is profound. It receives blood supply predominantly from the left hepatic artery, a branch of the common hepatic artery, which in turn arises from the celiac trunk. The portal venous drainage is managed through the left branch of the portal vein. Venous outflow is conducted through the left hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava. Biliary drainage from the medial segment converges into the left hepatic duct, which merges eventually to form the common bile duct. Histologically, the liver’s parenchyma within the left medial lobe, like other lobes, is composed of hepatocytes arranged in plates radiating from the central vein, with sinusoids conveying blood and Kupffer cells facilitating the removal of pathogens. Hepatocytes in this segment participate actively in metabolic activities such as glycogen storage, vitamin and protein synthesis, and detoxification. Clinically, the liver left medial lobe has implications in hepatic surgeries and interventions such as resection for liver cancers or hepatoblastoma, where precise knowledge of segmental anatomy ensures targeted and effective treatment. It is also significant in liver transplantation, where segment IV can be used as a graft. In imaging studies, such as CT and MRI, the liver left medial lobe can be distinctly identified, and its morphology critically assessed for diagnostic and preoperative planning purposes. Understanding the intricate anatomy and functionality of this segment, therefore, is essential for advanced hepatic study and clinical practice."
UBERON_0006729,"The liver perisinusoidal space, also known as Disse's space, hepatic perisinusoidal space, perisinusoidal space of Disse, space of Disse, or spatium perisinusoideum, is a specialized anatomical compartment within the liver. This extravascular space is situated between the liver's parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and the endothelial lining of the sinusoids, which are capillary-like blood vessels. The space is filled with blood plasma and plays a crucial role in the exchange of substances between the bloodstream and hepatocytes, facilitating metabolic activities. An essential aspect of the perisinusoidal space of Disse is the presence of microvilli on the hepatocyte surface, which increase surface area for efficient exchange of nutrients, hormones, and waste products. The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids are fenestrated, containing pores to allow plasma, but not blood cells, to permeate into this space, maintaining its plasma-rich environment. This fenestration ensures that large molecules such as proteins and lipoproteins can pass easily between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. The liver perisinusoidal space is also vital for the liver’s role in filtration and detoxification. Kupffer cells, which are liver-resident macrophages situated in the sinusoidal lumen, can interact closely with substances in Disse’s space, seizing pathogens and particulate matter. Additionally, hepatic stellate cells (also known as Ito cells) reside in the perisinusoidal space and play crucial roles in the regulation of extracellular matrix production and vitamin A storage. In pathological conditions, stellate cells can become activated and contribute to liver fibrosis by producing excessive extracellular matrix components. Disse's space is pivotal in hepatic microcirculation, contributing to the liver's ability to process various metabolites and detoxify substances efficiently. Any pathological alterations in the morphology or function of this space, such as those induced by chronic liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis or hepatitis), can severely impair liver function, disrupting metabolic homeostasis and leading to severe clinical outcomes. In summary, the liver perisinusoidal space of Disse is an anatomical and functional interface critical to hepatic physiology, emphasizing its importance in nutrient exchange, filtration, immune responses, and fibrosis. This space is a key component ensuring the liver’s multifaceted roles in metabolism, detoxification, and systemic homeostasis."
UBERON_0006841,"The central vein of the liver, also known as the terminal branch of the hepatic vein, terminal hepatic venule, and vena centralis (hepar), is an essential vascular structure located at the core of hepatic lobules. These veins are integral components in the architecture of the liver, a key organ responsible for various metabolic, detoxification, and synthetic functions. The hepatic lobules, which are the functional units of the liver, are polygonal structures organized around these central veins. Histologically, each lobule is made up of plates of hepatocytes arranged radially around the central vein, creating a spoke-like pattern. Blood flow within the lobules is directed from the periphery towards the central vein. Blood enters the lobules through the portal triads, which consist of branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. Oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery and nutrient-rich but deoxygenated blood from the portal vein mix within the sinusoids—specialized capillary spaces lined by endothelial and Kupffer cells. The mixed blood percolates through the sinusoids, allowing for efficient exchange of substances between the blood and hepatocytes. Hepatocytes perform metabolic activities, sequester toxins, and produce vital proteins. As the processed blood flows centripetally, it is collected by the central vein. The central veins subsequently drain blood into the sublobular veins, which converge to form the collecting tributaries of the hepatic veins. These larger hepatic veins ultimately drain into the inferior vena cava, thus completing the venous return from the liver to the systemic circulation. Pathophysiologically, the central vein of the liver is crucial in various liver ailments. Conditions such as chronic passive congestion due to right-sided heart failure often manifest with engorged central veins, a phenomenon termed ""nutmeg liver"" due to the characteristic mottled appearance. Additionally, central vein fibrosis is a feature in conditions like alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, where significant liver damage leads to the collapse and obstruction of these veins, disrupting normal hepatic architecture and function. In summary, the central vein of the liver, or the terminal branch of the hepatic vein, serves as a crucial vascular structure within hepatic lobules, playing a vital role in the organized flow and processing of blood within the liver, and is a key site for understanding various hepatic pathologies."
UBERON_0011955,"The left hepatic vein, also known as the vena hepatica sinistra, is a primary blood vessel responsible for draining deoxygenated blood from the left lobe of the liver into the inferior vena cava (IVC). This vein is one of three major hepatic veins, the others being the right hepatic vein and the middle hepatic vein. Anatomically, the left hepatic vein typically emerges from the superior aspect of the left lobe of the liver, collecting blood from the left hepatic segments, specifically segment II and segment III. It traverses the liver parenchyma and has its pathway directed toward the inferior vena cava, where it terminates after passing through the liver's diaphragm surface and contributes to the systemic venous circulation. Functionally, the left hepatic vein plays a critical role in hepatic blood flow regulation, facilitating the exit of the hepatic venous blood that has been oxygen-depleted and metabolite-rich from the left sections of the liver. This flow is vital for maintaining the liver's metabolic functions given the liver's extensive role in detoxification, synthesis of proteins, storage of glycogen, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. In terms of clinical significance, variations in the anatomy of the left hepatic vein can have profound implications. For instance, anomalies in the vein’s formation or its relationship with the inferior vena cava can predispose to complications during hepatic surgeries or interventional radiology procedures. Therapeutic interventions, such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), often necessitate precise anatomical knowledge of the hepatic veins, including the left hepatic vein. Moreover, the patency and structural integrity of the left hepatic vein are paramount in liver transplantation. Any obstructions or thrombosis of the vein may result in hepatic venous outflow obstruction, leading to conditions such as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial diagnostic tools for evaluating the left hepatic vein’s anatomy and functionality. Overall, the left hepatic vein is a vital component of the hepatobiliary system, whose fundamental role in venous blood drainage significantly impacts both the systemic and hepatic circulatory dynamics. Its relevance extends from basic anatomical and physiological understanding to intricate clinical applications and diagnostic challenges."
UBERON_0011956,"The right hepatic vein, also known as the right liver vein, is one of the three primary veins responsible for draining deoxygenated blood from the liver into the inferior vena cava. It is specifically involved in the drainage of the right lobe of the liver. Anatomically, the right hepatic vein typically courses through the hepatic parenchyma and collects blood from the anterior and posterior segments of the right lobe. It emerges from the dorsal aspect of the liver before entering the inferior vena cava just below the diaphragm. The vein plays a crucial role in the liver's blood circulation, handling approximately 70% of the liver's total venous outflow on the right side. It ensures that metabolic byproducts and blood processed by the liver are efficiently routed back to the heart. Structurally, the vein's intimal layer is thin and lined by endothelial cells, while its outer layer is supported by a small amount of connective tissue, facilitating its integration with liver tissue. The right hepatic vein's relevance extends into clinical medicine, especially in the context of liver surgeries and hepatic transplantations. Its patency and orientation are critical factors in liver resections, where surgeons must carefully manage and often ligate the vein to prevent excessive hemorrhage. Mismanagement during surgical procedures could lead to severe complications, including hemodynamic instability and impaired liver function. Pathologically, the right hepatic vein can be involved in various hepatic conditions. For instance, it may be subject to thrombosis, as seen in Budd-Chiari syndrome, which leads to liver congestion and subsequent ischemia. Vein obstruction necessitates timely medical or surgical intervention to restore normal blood flow. Imaging techniques, such as Doppler ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are instrumental in diagnosing conditions affecting the right hepatic vein. These modalities help visualize the vein's patency, anatomical variations, and hemodynamic characteristics, guiding both diagnosis and treatment strategies. From a developmental perspective, the right hepatic vein originates from the vitelline veins during embryogenesis, which gives rise to the hepatic venous system. Understanding its embryological origin is important for recognizing congenital anomalies, such as shunts or malformations, which may impact liver function and require early medical attention. In summary, the right hepatic vein (right liver vein) is integral to hepatic venous drainage, with significant implications in both normal physiology and pathological states, necessitating careful consideration in medical practice and liver-related surgical interventions."
UBERON_0011957,"The middle hepatic vein, also known as the vena hepatica media, is one of the principal hepatic veins responsible for draining blood from the liver into the inferior vena cava. Anatomically, the middle hepatic vein courses within the plane of the main lobar fissure, which demarcates the right and left hemilivers. Functionally, it serves as a critical component of the liver's venous drainage system, receiving blood from the central venous portions of both the right and left hepatic lobes. This vessel is particularly significant in hepatic lobectomy procedures, as it lies between Couinaud's segments IVa and IVb on the left and segments V and VIII on the right, thus providing a landmark for surgical resection and transplantation. The middle hepatic vein is situated between the right and left hepatic veins, and its anatomy is highly variable among individuals; however, it typically drains segments IV, V, and VIII. The confluence of the hepatic veins, including the middle hepatic vein, occurs at the liver's superior aspect, often forming a short common trunk before emptying into the inferior vena cava. This structure is enveloped by Glisson's capsule where it penetrates the liver parenchyma. The liver's segmental anatomy and its functional unit, the hepatic lobule, are integral to understanding the middle hepatic vein's role. Blood flow within this circulatory pathway begins with the delivery of partially deoxygenated blood from the hepatic portal vein and oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery into the liver sinusoids. After nutrient exchange and detoxification within the hepatic lobules, blood is collected by the central veins of each lobule, which merge to form the larger hepatic veins, including the middle hepatic vein. Imaging modalities like ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are instrumental in visualizing the middle hepatic vein for both diagnostic and preoperative planning purposes. Variations in the vein’s size, course, and point of entry into the inferior vena cava are well-documented, necessitating individualized imaging assessments. Pathological conditions affecting the middle hepatic vein, such as thrombosis, can lead to serious hepatic dysfunction and clinical manifestations like Budd-Chiari syndrome. In such cases, interventional radiology techniques, such as thrombolysis or stenting, and surgical approaches may be required to restore venous outflow and liver function. In summary, the middle hepatic vein, or vena hepatica media, is a vital anatomical and functional component of the liver's vascular system, playing a crucial role in hepatic venous drainage and serving as an important anatomical landmark in hepatic surgery and transplantation."
UBERON_0013138,"The coronary ligament of the liver, also known as the ligamentum coronarium or ligamentum coronarium hepatis, consists of peritoneal reflections that anchor the liver to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. These reflections include the superior and inferior layers, which together form a continuous structure encircling the bare area of the liver – a region devoid of peritoneal covering. The superior layer of the coronary ligament arises from the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver, extending dorsally to attach to the diaphragmatic surface. The inferior layer extends from the diaphragmatic side of the liver to the caudate lobe, merging anteriorly with peritoneal reflections of the falciform ligament. The bare area of the liver, demarcated by these coronary ligament layers, represents a zone directly fused with the diaphragm, allowing venous and lymphatic drainage to transit unencumbered by peritoneal coverings. The coronary ligament plays a critical role in maintaining anatomical positioning and stability of the liver, ensuring proper alignment with surrounding structures and facilitating diaphragmatic motion impact on hepatic function. Further contributing to the functional integrity of the liver's positioning are the triangular ligaments, formed by the lateral extensions of the coronary ligament: the right triangular ligament at the junction of the right lobe and diaphragm, and the left triangular ligament at the conjunction of the left lobe and diaphragm. These extensions provide additional anchorage and structural support to the hepatic architecture. Histologically, the coronary ligament is composed of two layers of peritoneal mesothelium encapsulating a core of dense connective tissue composed primarily of collagen fibers, which offer mechanical strength. This ligamentous architecture is vital in the context of intra-abdominal pressure dynamics, liver mobilization during respiration, and maintaining vascular and biliary conduit integrity by preventing excessive organ displacement. From a clinical perspective, variations or abnormalities in the integrity or disposition of the coronary ligament can impact hepatic surgery approaches, risk of liver displacement in trauma, and considerations during procedures such as liver transplantation. Moreover, understanding the embryological development of these peritoneal reflections provides insight into congenital anomalies involving hepatic positioning or diaphragmatic defects. Thus, the coronary ligament of the liver, or ligamentum coronarium hepatis, is a fundamental structure in the orchestration of hepatic support, diaphragmatic linkage, and peritoneal anatomy."
UBERON_0013139,"The ligament of liver, also known as the hepatic ligament or liver ligament, is a nonskeletal ligamentous structure that provides anatomical support to the liver by anchoring it to the surrounding tissues and structures. Distinguished from ligaments associated with the skeletal system, hepatic ligaments are fibrous connective tissues that serve to maintain the position and stability of the liver within the abdominal cavity. There are several important hepatic ligaments, each with specific connections and functional roles: 1. **Falciform Ligament**: This ligament is an extension of the parietal peritoneum that attaches the anterior surface of the liver to the anterior abdominal wall and the diaphragm. It also contains the ligamentum teres, a remnant of the fetal umbilical vein, along its free edge. 2. **Coronary Ligament**: The coronary ligament is composed of anterior and posterior layers that secure the liver to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. These layers are continuous with the falciform ligament and demarcate the bare area of the liver, where it is in direct contact with the diaphragm and lacks peritoneal covering. 3. **Triangular Ligaments (Right and Left)**: These triangular extensions of the coronary ligament are located at the lateral edges of the liver. The right triangular ligament connects the right lobe to the diaphragm, while the left triangular ligament connects the left lobe to the diaphragm. 4. **Hepatogastric Ligament**: Part of the lesser omentum, the hepatogastric ligament extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, facilitating the passage of vessels and nerves between these organs. 5. **Hepatoduodenal Ligament**: Also part of the lesser omentum, this ligament connects the liver to the first segment of the duodenum. It contains the portal triad, comprising the portal vein, hepatic artery, and common bile duct, thus playing a critical role in the vascular and biliary systems of the liver. Collectively, these hepatic ligaments are essential for maintaining the anatomical integrity of the liver, enabling it to withstand the physiological movements of the abdominal cavity, and ensuring proper vascular and biliary communication. They highlight the complex interplay between structure and function in the hepatobiliary system, reflecting the liver's pivotal role in metabolism, detoxification, and homeostasis."
UBERON_0015481,"The left hepatic artery, also known as the left branch of the hepatic artery, left part of hepatic artery proper, or ramus sinister (arteria hepatica propria), is a critical arterial structure that supplies oxygenated blood to the left lobe of the liver. This artery is typically a branch of the proper hepatic artery, which itself is a continuation of the common hepatic artery originating from the celiac trunk, a major branch of the abdominal aorta. Anatomically, the left hepatic artery courses within the lesser omentum and enters the liver at the porta hepatis, where it typically bifurcates into smaller branches. These branches penetrate the liver parenchyma and follow the liver’s portal triads, accompanying the portal vein and bile ducts to supply the functional units of the liver, the hepatic lobules. In addition to supplying the left lobe of the liver, the left hepatic artery may also give off branches that supply adjacent hepatic segments or other liver structures, depending on anatomical variability. Such variations are critically important in hepatic surgeries, liver transplants, and radiological interventions, where precise knowledge of hepatic arterial anatomy is paramount to avoid complications such as ischemia or inadvertent injury. Functionally, the left hepatic artery ensures the delivery of oxygenated blood necessary for metabolic processes and detoxification activities carried out by hepatocytes. It complements the dual blood supply to the liver along with the portal vein, which carries nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor blood from the gastrointestinal tract. Anomalies in the left hepatic artery's origin, course, or distribution are not uncommon. In some individuals, the left hepatic artery may arise anomalously from the left gastric artery or may exhibit variations such as an accessory hepatic artery or a replaced hepatic artery. Such variations can significantly impact clinical procedures and require detailed preoperative imaging for accurate delineation. In summary, the left hepatic artery, or left branch of hepatic artery, left part of hepatic artery proper, ramus sinister (arteria hepatica propria), plays a vital role in the vascularization of the left lobe of the liver, ensuring adequate supply of oxygenated blood.

Originating from the hepatic artery proper, which itself is a branch of the common hepatic artery, the right hepatic artery diverges from the left hepatic artery at the porta hepatis. The right hepatic artery typically courses posterior to the hepatic duct, occasionally giving rise to cystic artery branches that supply the gallbladder. This artery plays a pivotal role in providing necessary nutrients and oxygen to hepatocytes in the right lobe, supporting their metabolic functions, bile production, and detoxification processes. The vascular anatomy of the right hepatic artery can exhibit variations. In some cases, the artery may arise directly from the superior mesenteric artery, a condition known as a replaced right hepatic artery. Alternatively, it may originate from other sources like the gastroduodenal artery, emphasizing the importance of preoperative imaging studies to map this vessel accurately. During hepatic surgery, liver transplantation, or procedures such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), understanding the exact course and branching pattern of the right hepatic artery is indispensable to avoid iatrogenic injury and ensure adequate perfusion of the liver tissue. In summary, the right hepatic artery or right branch of the hepatic artery proper (ramus dexter arteria hepatica propria), is a major vessel critical for sustaining the hepatic metabolic activities, emphasizing the importance of its anatomical knowledge in clinical practices involving the liver."
UBERON_0015796,"A liver blood vessel, also known as a hepatic blood vessel, is a crucial component of the liver's intricate vascular network. This category includes the hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and the portal vein, each playing specific roles in maintaining liver function and overall metabolism. The hepatic arteries branch off from the celiac trunk and supply oxygen-rich arterial blood to the liver. This oxygenated blood is necessary for the metabolism, detoxification, and synthesis processes carried out by hepatocytes, the main functional cells of the liver. The hepatic artery branches extensively, ensuring that oxygen delivery is evenly distributed throughout the organ. The portal vein is another key vessel, transporting nutrient-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen directly to the liver. This blood carries the products of digestion, including glucose, amino acids, and lipids, which are processed and stored by the liver. The portal vein is formed by the convergence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein, it plays a vital role in the first-pass metabolism, where the liver detoxifies potential toxins before they reach systemic circulation. Hepatic veins drain deoxygenated blood and metabolic byproducts from the liver into the inferior vena cava, which then flows back into the heart. This venous blood includes bilirubin, a waste product of hemoglobin breakdown, and various other metabolic waste substances which the liver has processed. Together, these liver blood vessels facilitate the organ's dual blood supply, which is unique compared to other organs in the body. They provide liver cells with essential substrates for its metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification activities while also carrying away processed metabolites and waste products. The architecture of these vessels within the liver forms a specialized microcirculation system known as the hepatic sinusoidal network, facilitating efficient exchange between the blood and hepatic cells. Compromises or pathologies affecting any component of these liver blood vessels, such as hepatic artery stenosis, portal vein thrombosis, or hepatic vein obstruction, can severely impact liver function and lead to significant clinical conditions. Therefore, understanding the critical role of liver blood vessels is essential for diagnosing and treating hepatic vascular disorders. In summary, liver blood vessels, encompassing hepatic arteries, portal vein, and hepatic veins, are essential for delivering and removing blood from the liver, thus supporting its diverse and vital physiological roles."

It includes an intricate network of extracellular matrix, composed primarily of collagen fibers, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, which provides both structural and biochemical support to the parenchymal cells, primarily hepatocytes. The liver stroma harbors non-parenchymal cell populations, including hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells), Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), and endothelial cells lining the sinusoidal spaces. Hepatic stellate cells play a crucial role in the storage of vitamin A and, upon activation, they transform into myofibroblasts and contribute to fibrosis by secreting excess ECM components. Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages responsible for the phagocytosis of pathogens, cellular debris, and the modulation of immune responses. Endothelial cells in the liver are fenestrated, allowing for efficient exchange of substances between the blood and liver parenchyma. They also release cytokines and growth factors that influence liver function and regeneration. The architecture of the hepatic stroma is characterized by a complex interplay between the ECM and cellular elements, crucial for maintaining liver homeostasis and function. The stroma provides structural integrity to hepatic lobules, the functional units of the liver, and plays an essential role in supporting the vascular and biliary systems within the organ. Blood flows through the sinusoidal capillaries, allowing for efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange and detoxification processes. During liver injury, the hepatic stroma undergoes dynamic changes, often marked by the activation of stellate cells and an increase in fibrous tissue deposition, leading to fibrosis. Chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, manifest as extensive remodeling of the stroma, significantly impairing liver function. The liver stroma also acts as a niche for hepatic progenitor cells, contributing to liver regeneration following injury. Overall, the hepatic stroma is integral to the liver's structural integrity and functional performance, involving a complex matrix environment and diverse cell populations that interact to maintain the organ's physiological and reparative capacities."
UBERON_0016479,"The capsule of the liver, also known as the capsula fibrosa perivascularis, fibrous capsule of liver, Glisson's capsule, hepatic capsule, tunica fibrosa (hepar), or tunica fibrosa hepatis, is a dense layer of connective tissue that envelopes the external surface of the liver. This capsule is composed predominantly of collagenous fibers, with interspersed elastic fibers that provide both rigidity and flexibility, ensuring the liver's structural integrity while allowing for volume changes due to blood flow and metabolic activity. Glisson's capsule serves not only as a protective barrier but also interacts integrally with the hepatic vasculature and parenchyma. It extends inward at the porta hepatis, surrounding the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile ducts, continuing as a perivascular sheath. This perivascular extension is crucial for maintaining the architecture of the liver lobules and supporting the microvascular structures integral to liver function. Histologically, the capsule varies in thickness across different regions of the liver, being thicker near the porta hepatis and thinner towards the periphery. The capsule is richly innervated, containing numerous nerve fibers, and holds a significant number of sensory receptors, making it sensitive to stretching and distension caused by hepatomegaly or other pathological conditions. Functionally, the fibrous capsule provides mechanical protection against physical damage and acts as a barrier to the spread of infections and metastatic cells into the liver. Additionally, it is involved in the hepatic immune response, participating in the sequestration and elimination of pathogens that breach the systemic circulation. Fibroblasts within the capsule contribute to extracellular matrix production and modulate liver fibrosis through interactions with hepatic stellate cells, particularly during chronic liver disease states. In clinical pathology, alterations to the capsule, such as thickening or fibrosis, can be indicative of underlying liver conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatic malignancies. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI frequently assess the capsule's appearance to help identify these abnormalities. Overall, the capsule of the liver (capsula fibrosa perivascularis, fibrous capsule of liver, Glisson's capsule, hepatic capsule, tunica fibrosa (hepar), tunica fibrosa hepatis) provides a critical structural and functional role, safeguarding hepatic tissue and maintaining proper organ physiology while actively participating in disease processes and immune responses."
UBERON_0035444,"The triangular ligament of the liver, also known as the triangular hepatic ligament, consists of two distinct components: the right triangular ligament and the left triangular ligament. These ligaments are crucial anatomical structures that connect the liver to the diaphragm, helping to stabilize its position within the abdominal cavity. The right triangular ligament, formed by the convergence of the anterior and posterior layers of the coronary ligament, attaches the right lobe of the liver to the diaphragm. Conversely, the left triangular ligament is formed in a similar manner around the left lobe of the liver. The coronary ligament is essentially a folded extension of the peritoneum, the serous membrane lining the abdominal cavity. Both triangular ligaments represent the continuation of the coronary ligament's lateral borders where its two leaflets conjoin. The right and left triangular ligaments taper off to their respective points of attachment, securing the liver in place. The right triangular ligament is typically shorter and more robust, aiding in the stabilization of the larger right lobe of the liver. The left triangular ligament, though often longer and less substantial, performs a similar function for the smaller left lobe. These ligaments play an essential role in the liver’s anatomical positioning and function. By tethering the liver to the diaphragm, they help maintain the organ's orientation relative to neighboring structures such as the stomach, inferior vena cava, and the esophagus. This positioning is vital not only for physiological stability but also for the functional efficiency of hepatic blood flow and biliary drainage. Anatomically, variations can occur in the configuration of the triangular ligaments, and their precise morphology can differ between individuals. It is important for clinicians and surgeons to be aware of these variations, as the ligaments are encountered in procedures involving the liver, such as hepatectomies or liver transplantations. In rare instances, the ligaments can be involved in pathological conditions such as fibrosis or inflammation secondary to peritoneal diseases or hepatic pathologies, which may impact their structural integrity and the liver’s mobility. Knowledge of the triangular ligament of the liver is thus essential not only in understanding hepatic anatomy and physiology but also in clinical applications involving hepatic surgery and diagnostics. In summary, the triangular ligament of the liver, encompassing both the right and left triangular ligaments, serves as an integral component of the hepatic support system, anchoring the liver to the diaphragm and maintaining its positional stability within the abdominal cavity."
UBERON_0039222,"The cystic artery, also known as the cholecystic artery, is a vital blood vessel responsible for delivering oxygenated blood to the gallbladder and the cystic duct. Arising predominantly from the right hepatic artery, though variations may exist, this artery typically branches off within the hepatobiliary triangle, also known as Calot's triangle, which is bordered by the cystic duct, the common hepatic duct, and the inferior edge of the liver. The cystic artery usually bifurcates into superficial (anterior) and deep (posterior) branches, which ensure comprehensive vascularization of the gallbladder body and neck. These branches traverse the gallbladder serosa either directly or via an anastomotic network, facilitating efficient blood supply to the biliary mucosa and muscular layers. Functionally, the cystic artery’s role is critical in maintaining the physiological functions of the gallbladder, including bile storage and concentration. Surgical relevance of the cystic artery is paramount, particularly during cholecystectomy procedures, where secure identification and ligation of this artery are necessary to prevent hemorrhage. Inconsistent anatomical presentations necessitate precise preoperative imaging or intraoperative dissection to avoid complications. Anatomical variations include cases where the cystic artery emerges from the gastroduodenal artery, the left hepatic artery, or even branches directly from the common hepatic artery. These variations mandate vigilance during surgical interventions. The artery's relationship with surrounding anatomical structures is essential for its functional role. The cystic artery often courses behind or anterior to the cystic duct, and its deep branch may run closely to the right hepatic duct or portal vein branches, arising potential for inadvertent injury during complex hepatobiliary surgeries. Pathologically, cystic artery occlusion or thrombosis, although rare, can result in ischemic complications affecting gallbladder function, leading to potential necrosis or gangrene.
