M0002477,"Bile Canaliculi, also known as Bile Canaliculus, Canaliculi Bile, or Canaliculus Bile, are minute intercellular channels situated between hepatocytes within the liver. These narrow tubular spaces serve as the initial conduit for bile produced by hepatocytes. Structured by intricate tight junctions between adjacent liver cells, bile canaliculi ensure efficient bile secretion into the bile duct system. The primary function of bile canaliculi is to collect bile synthesized by hepatocytes and direct it toward the larger bile ducts, eventually leading to the interlobular bile ducts or the bile duct proper. This process is essential for the digestion and absorption of lipids. Bile, comprising bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and bilirubin, plays a crucial role in emulsifying dietary fats and facilitating their absorption in the small intestine. The architecture of bile canaliculi includes a network of microvilli on the apical surfaces of hepatocytes projecting into the canaliculi lumen. These microvilli enhance the surface area available for bile secretion. The tight junctions (zonula occludens) integral to bile canaliculi restrict bile leakage into the surrounding hepatocyte space, maintaining directionality in bile flow. Bile canaliculi merge into larger bile ductules (Canals of Hering) which further coalesce into interlobular bile ducts. These subsequently form the left and right hepatic bile ducts before converging into the common hepatic duct, culminating at the common bile duct for storage in the gallbladder or release into the duodenum. Pathologically, disruption or impairment of bile canaliculi can result in cholestasis, where bile flow is obstructed or reduced, causing bile components to accumulate within the liver. Such conditions may result from genetic disorders (e.g., Alagille syndrome, Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis), infections, toxins, or autoimmune diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis). Chronic impairment can lead to liver damage, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. In liver histology, bile canaliculi are distinguished by bile-specific stains (e.g., bilirubin immunostaining or enzyme histochemistry for alkaline phosphatase) enhancing their visibility within the liver parenchyma. Understanding the biology and pathology of bile canaliculi is crucial for diagnosing and managing liver ailments associated with bile production and secretion. In summary, bile canaliculi, also referred to as bile capillaries, represent an essential component of the biliary system facilitating bile transport from hepatocytes to bile ducts, vital for metabolic and digestive processes within the liver."
M0002483,"Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic, also known as Bile Duct, Intrahepatic; Duct, Intrahepatic Bile; Ducts, Intrahepatic Bile; Intrahepatic Bile Duct; Intrahepatic Bile Ducts, refer to the network of ducts located within the liver parenchyma responsible for conducting bile from the liver cells (hepatocytes) to the extrahepatic biliary system. Bile, produced by hepatocytes, is a critical digestive fluid that aids in the emulsification and absorption of lipids in the small intestine. The intrahepatic biliary tree begins with the bile canaliculi, which are microscopic channels formed by adjacent hepatocytes. Bile canaliculi coalesce to form the smallest bile ductules, known as the canals of Hering, which are lined by both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. These ductules drain into progressively larger interlobular bile ducts, which feature a simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium surrounded by a fibrous stroma. As the interlobular ducts converge, they form segmental and sectional ducts that repeatedly unite, increasing in caliber, eventually forming the right and left hepatic ducts. These major ducts drain bile from the right and left lobes of the liver, respectively. The right and left hepatic ducts typically exit the liver parenchyma and join to form the common hepatic duct, which represents the commencement of the extrahepatic biliary ducts. The intrahepatic bile ducts are integral not only in bile transport but also play significant roles in the pathophysiology of various hepatobiliary diseases including cholangiocarcinoma, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and biliary atresia. Diagnostic imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), as well as histopathological examinations, are essential in evaluating the integrity and pathology of these ducts. Cellular and molecular studies of the cholangiocytes lining the intrahepatic bile ducts have expanded our understanding of their secretory and proliferative capacities, immune function, and response to injury. Advances in regenerative medicine and stem cell biology also explore potential therapeutic avenues involving the intrahepatic bile ducts. Overall, the intrahepatic bile ducts form a vital conduit for bile transport from hepatocytes to the intestine and involve complex anatomical, physiological, and pathological processes. Understanding these ducts, including the right and left hepatic ducts that play critical roles in bile drainage, remains essential in hepatobiliary biology and medicine."
M000606073,"The Round Ligament of the Liver, also known as the Ligamentum Teres Hepatis or Liver Round Ligament, is a fibrous remnant of the obliterated left umbilical vein from fetal development. In the fetus, the left umbilical vein transports oxygenated blood from the placenta to the developing liver and heart. After birth, when the umbilical cord is cut and no longer functions, this vein closes and undergoes fibrous transformation, resulting in the formation of the round ligament. Anatomically, the round ligament of the liver is situated in the free margin of the falciform ligament, which is a double-layered fold of peritoneum that extends from the anterior abdominal wall and diaphragm to the liver, separating the organ into right and left lobes. The round ligament itself descends along the inferior edge of the falciform ligament towards the umbilicus. It may also be associated with paraumbilical veins within the ligament, which can become significant in conditions involving portal hypertension, providing collateral pathways for blood flow. The round ligament continues its path on the visceral surface of the liver towards the ligamentum venosum and the fissure for the ligamentum teres, which are anatomical landmarks that mark the historical vascular paths during fetal circulation. In the adult liver, it no longer serves a vascular function but holds potential surgical and anatomical significance, particularly in procedures like liver transplantation, hepatic lobectomies, and the management of hepatic neoplasms. The round ligament may also be palpable during physical examination, particularly in cases of hepatomegaly or intra-abdominal pathology. Histologically, the round ligament of the liver consists of dense fibrous connective tissue with remnants of the vascular endothelium that once lined the umbilical vein. Surrounding this central fibrous core, there may be an accumulation of adipose tissue and small vessels. Its transformation from a patent vessel into a fibrous cord is a remarkable instance of evolutionary adaptation postnatally, reflecting the vital transition from placenta-based to independent systemic circulation upon birth. Understanding the round ligament of the liver, including its development, anatomical relationships, and potential clinical implications, is essential for advanced medical and biological studies. Its role as a vestigial structure, once crucial in fetal life, provides significant insights into the dynamic nature of human anatomy and its adaptations."
M0012632,"The liver, also known as 'hepar,' is a large lobed glandular organ located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, beneath the diaphragm in vertebrates. This vital organ is a central hub for numerous essential physiological processes, including detoxification, metabolism, synthesis, and storage of various substances. Structurally, the liver is divided into lobes and is composed of specialized cells known as hepatocytes, which perform the majority of its biochemical functions. Detoxification is a primary role of the liver, whereby it neutralizes and eliminates harmful substances from the blood. This includes the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous waste products such as ammonia. Hepatocytes contain enzymes that catalyze oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and conjugation reactions, rendering toxic compounds more water-soluble for excretion via bile or urine. The liver is essential in metabolism, particularly in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. It regulates blood glucose levels through glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Lipid metabolism in the liver involves the synthesis and breakdown of fats, including the production of cholesterol and triglycerides, and the formation of lipoproteins. Protein metabolism encompasses the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, the conversion of ammonia to urea via the urea cycle, and the production of plasma proteins such as albumin and clotting factors. The liver also plays a significant role in bile production and secretion. Bile, a greenish-yellow fluid containing bile acids, cholesterol, and waste products like bilirubin, is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) in the intestines. The liver secretes bile into bile ducts, which eventually empty into the small intestine via the gallbladder. Additionally, the liver functions as a storage organ for essential nutrients and minerals. It stores glycogen, a form of glucose, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), as well as metals such as iron and copper. These stored compounds are released into the bloodstream as needed to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, the liver has a remarkable regenerative capacity, allowing it to recover from damage and restore its function. This regenerative ability is crucial for its role in maintaining overall physiological balance and responding to injury or disease. In summary, the liver (hepar) is an indispensable organ involved in detoxification, metabolism, synthesis, storage, bile production, and secretion, thus playing a critical role in maintaining homeostasis within the body."
