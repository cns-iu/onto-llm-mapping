UBERON_0001113,"The lobes of the liver, also referred to as hepatic lobes or lobus hepatis, are anatomical divisions of the organ based on its surface features and internal structure. Traditionally, the liver is divided into four lobes: right, left, caudate, and quadrate. The division is primarily achieved through the presence of the falciform ligament, which separates the left from the right lobe. The left anatomical lobe is smaller than the right and occupies a position on the anterior wall of the abdomen. It is bounded superiorly by the diaphragm and inferiorly by the transverse fissure, which separates it from the quadrate lobe of the caudate division. The left lobe is further subdivided into two segments: left medial segment II and left lateral segment III. In contrast, the right anatomical lobe is larger and extends to the diaphragm on the right side. It is bounded inferiorly by the coronary ligament, which separates it from the quadrate lobe of the caudate division. The right lobe is further subdivided into three segments: right medial segment III, right lateral segment IV, and right posterior segment V. The caudate lobe, also referred to as the conoid or quadrate lobe, is a small, triangular extension of the liver that separates the left and right lobes. It is situated on the inferior surface of the liver and is connected to both the left and right lobes by biliary ducts. Understanding the anatomy of the liver lobes is crucial for surgeons and interventional radiologists who perform procedures such as liver resection, transplantation, or ablation therapy. Accurate identification and localization of liver lesions are also essential for precise treatment planning in oncology and other medical specialties."
UBERON_0001114,"The right lobe of liver, also known as lobus hepaticus dexter or right liver lobe, is the larger of the two liver lobes that comprise the liver organ. This lobe occupies a significant portion of the right hypochondrium region and is separated from the left lobe by several anatomical structures. The right lobe has a somewhat quadrilateral form, with its under and posterior surfaces marked by three distinct fossæ: the porta hepatis (hepatic portal vein), the fossæ for the gallbladder and inferior vena cava, which separate its left part into two smaller lobes. The quadrate lobe is located in the upper right region of the liver, while the caudate lobe is situated at the posterior surface. The boundary between the right and left lobes is established by the falciform ligament, which separates the upper surface of the right lobe from the left lobe. The left sagittal fossa marks the separation between the under and posterior surfaces of the right lobe. In front, the umbilical notch delineates the boundary between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall. The right lobe's size is proportionally greater than that of the left lobe, with a ratio of approximately six to one. This anatomical variation can be an important consideration in various medical procedures, such as surgical interventions or diagnostic imaging. Understanding the anatomy of the liver lobes, including the right lobe, is essential for clinicians and researchers to accurately diagnose and treat conditions affecting this vital organ."
UBERON_0001115,"The left lobe of the liver, also referred to as the left liver lobe, liver left lobe, or lobus hepaticus sinister, is one of two main divisions of the liver. It is smaller and more flattened than its counterpart, the right lobe, which occupies a larger portion of the abdominal cavity. Anatomically, the left lobe is situated in the epigastric region, bordered by the costal margin to the left and the inferior vena cava to the right. Its upper surface is slightly convex and is molded against the diaphragm, whereas its lower surface presents a gastric impression and omental tuberosity. The liver's lobular arrangement is typically divided into eight segments, with the left lobe comprising segments II and III. These segments are bounded by the falciform ligament to the right and the umbilical fissure to the left. The left lobe also contains the gallbladder, which is suspended from the under surface of the liver. The left lobe's vascular supply includes the hepatic artery and portal vein branches that originate from the common hepatic artery and portal vein, respectively. These arteries provide oxygenated blood and nutrients to the liver tissue, while the portal vein brings nutrient-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract. In terms of surgical anatomy, the left lobe is often resected during hepatectomies due to its smaller size and location. This can be advantageous in cases where the right lobe is too large or damaged to preserve. The lobes of the liver are also important in radiological imaging, as they provide a reference point for evaluating liver morphology and detecting abnormalities such as tumors or atrophy. The left lobe's more slender shape makes it easier to distinguish from adjacent structures during imaging studies. In summary, the left lobe of the liver plays a crucial role in the overall function and anatomy of this"
UBERON_0001116,"The lobus quadratus hepatis, also known as the quadrate lobe of the liver, is a unique anatomical structure situated on the underside of the right lobe of the liver. Its boundaries are defined by distinct landmarks: anteriorly, it is demarcated by the liver's anterior margin; posteriorly, it is bounded by the porta hepatis, a vascular confluence that connects the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile ducts; on its right side, the fossa for the gallbladder serves as a limiting boundary; and on its left side, the fossa for the umbilical vein marks its lateral edge. The lobus quadratus hepatis is characterized by an oblong shape, with its antero-posterior diameter exceeding its transverse dimension. This distinctive morphology is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that accommodates specific physiological functions associated with this region of the liver. The quadrate lobe's unique configuration may facilitate specialized metabolic pathways or serve as a niche for specific cell types. The lobus quadratus hepatis is located anteriorly, medial to the falciform ligament, and posterior to the caudate lobe. Its position relative to other liver segments can lead to variations in the extent of its involvement in certain pathologies. The quadrate lobe's proximity to the porta hepatis and the gallbladder fossa positions it at a critical juncture for the transmission of bile from the liver into the biliary system. The lobus quadratus hepatis is relatively small compared to other liver segments, weighing approximately 50-70 grams. Its compact size belies its importance in liver function, as it contains unique cellular populations and specialized metabolic machinery that contribute to overall hepatocellular activity. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific physiological roles of this enigmatic structure within the liver's complex functional landscape."
UBERON_0001117,"The caudate lobe, also referred to as Couinaud hepatic segment I, hepatovenous segment I, liver caudate lobe, lobus caudatus, and Spiegelian lobe, is a unique and complex anatomical structure situated on the right lobe of the liver. It is bounded by the physiological division of the liver called the ligamentum venosum on its left side, the porta below, the fossa for the inferior vena cava to its right, and the fossa for the ductus venosus to its left. The caudate lobe is characterized by a nearly vertical position, with a longer longitudinal dimension than transverse axis. It exhibits a concave shape in the transverse direction and extends laterally from the lower extremity of the liver towards the under surface of the right lobe. This process, known as the hepatic caudate process, separates the fossa for the gallbladder from the commencement of the fossa for the inferior vena cava. A distinctive feature of the caudate lobe is its own caval anastomosis, which allows it to maintain function despite occlusion of hepatic venous outflow. This anomaly can lead to hypertrophy of the caudate lobe in cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome, a condition characterized by thrombosis or obstruction of the hepatic veins. Anatomically, the caudate lobe is composed of liver tissue that receives blood supply from both the left and right hepatic arteries. Its venous drainage is unique in that it forms a collateral network with other segments of the liver, bypassing the normal hepatic vein pathway. This anastomotic network enables the caudate lobe to continue functioning even when the main hepatic veins are obstructed. In terms of surgical and clinical significance, the caudate"
UBERON_0001143,"The hepatic vein, also referred to as the vein of liver or vena hepatica, is a vital component of the venous drainage system of the liver. This unique structure plays a crucial role in the removal of deoxygenated blood from the liver and its subsequent transportation to the heart. The hepatic veins are short, straight vessels that arise from the surface of the liver and merge to form the superior and inferior vena cavae. There are three main hepatic veins, each corresponding to one of the lobes of the liver: the right hepatic vein, middle hepatic vein, and left hepatic vein. These veins drain blood from the hepatic sinusoids, which are narrow channels within the liver parenchyma where oxygenated blood is delivered to the hepatocytes. The hepatic veins are characterized by their unique morphology, with a relatively small diameter and a straight course that allows for efficient removal of blood from the liver. They also have a prominent muscular layer, which enables them to maintain tone and facilitate the transport of blood through the liver. Upon merging with the superior or inferior vena cavae, the hepatic veins convey deoxygenated blood to the heart, where it is pumped into the pulmonary circuit for oxygenation. The hepatic veins also contain valves that prevent backflow of blood from the heart to the liver, ensuring that oxygen-depleted blood does not re-enter the liver. The hepatic vein system plays a critical role in maintaining liver function and overall cardiovascular health. Any abnormalities or blockages in this system can lead to impaired liver drainage, resulting in conditions such as portal hypertension and ascites. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the hepatic veins is essential for diagnosing and treating various liver disorders and vascular diseases."
UBERON_0001149,"The bare area of liver, also referred to as area nuda (hepar) or area nuda hepatis, is a unique and distinct region of the liver that lacks a peritoneal covering. This area is bounded by the falciform ligament to the left and the free edge of the diaphragm to the right, thereby separating it from the rest of the liver. The bare area of liver is characterized by its exposed surface, which is directly connected to the abdominal cavity, in contrast to the majority of the liver which is covered by a peritoneal layer. This lack of peritoneal coverage distinguishes the bare area from the more typical hepatic parenchyma that surrounds it. The bare area serves several important functions within the body's anatomy and physiology. One key function is its role in supporting the falciform ligament, which attaches to this area. The falciform ligament plays a significant role in securing the left lobe of the liver to the anterior abdominal wall, thereby stabilizing the liver and preventing it from shifting or being displaced. Furthermore, the bare area also contains various structures such as the round ligament of the liver and the umbilical vein, which provide important connections between the liver and other organs within the body. The presence of these structures underscores the importance of this region in maintaining overall bodily function and homeostasis. Anatomically, the bare area is often noted for its relatively thin layer of tissue, which contrasts with the more substantial hepatic parenchyma that surrounds it. This difference in thickness highlights the unique nature of this region within the liver's complex anatomy. Despite its importance, the bare area of liver remains a somewhat controversial subject among anatomists and surgeons due to its variability in size and location from person to person. Nonetheless, understanding the structure and function of this distinct region is essential for diagnosing and treating various conditions affecting the"
UBERON_0001247,"The falciform ligament, also known as the ligamentum falciforme (hepatis), is a fibrous structure that attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. It is characterized by its broad and thin antero-posterior peritoneal fold, which gives it a falciform shape. The ligament's base is directed downward and backward, while its apex is upward and backward. Developmentally, the falciform ligament is a remnant of the ventral mesentery of the fetus. As such, it arises from the embryonic tissue that would eventually form the lesser omentum and the falciform ligament's unique orientation reflects this developmental origin. Anatomically, the ligament lies obliquely in an antero-posterior plane but is angled so that one surface faces forward and comes into contact with the peritoneum behind the right rectus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm. The other surface is directed backward and is in contact with the left lobe of the liver. The falciform ligament is composed of two layers of peritoneum that are closely united together. Its base or free edge contains the round ligament, which connects to the umbilicus, and the paraumbilical veins, which drain blood from the liver. In terms of attachment points, the left margin of the falciform ligament is anchored to the under surface of the diaphragm and the posterior surface of the sheath surrounding the right rectus abdominis muscle as far down as the umbilicus. The right margin extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, tracing its way backward to the posterior surface. The falciform ligament plays a crucial role in supporting the liver and maintaining its position within the abdominal cavity. It is a key landmark in anatomical dissections and surgical procedures involving the liver."
UBERON_0001279,"The portal triad, also referred to as the trias hepatica, is a characteristic multi-organ-part structure that comprises three essential vessels of the liver's portal lobule. This arrangement consists of the bile duct, which conveys bile produced by hepatocytes towards the gallbladder or intestine for digestion; a terminal branch of the hepatic artery, supplying oxygenated blood to meet the high metabolic demands of liver tissue; and the portal vein, carrying deoxygenated blood rich in nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract. The trias hepatica is typically situated within the lobule's central area and serves as the primary site for exchange of nutrients, waste products, and metabolites between the liver and the rest of the body. In addition to these three major vessels, a lymphatic vessel may also be present within the portal triad, further facilitating the removal of waste materials and metabolic byproducts. This intricate arrangement enables the liver to effectively process and detoxify ingested substances, regulate blood composition, and maintain homeostasis. Anatomically, the portal triad is typically bounded by the terminal branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein, which converge to form a common channel that enters the liver's portal lobule. The bile duct, often running in tandem with these vessels, drains into the central area of the lobule before exiting the liver via the common hepatic duct. Understanding the portal triad is essential for appreciating the complex interplay between nutrient uptake, metabolism, and waste removal within the liver. The trias hepatica plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal liver function, and its disruption can lead to various pathological conditions, including hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis."
UBERON_0001280,"The liver parenchyma, also referred to as hepatic parenchyma, liver parenchyme, or simply parenchyma of the liver, is the main functional unit of the liver. It consists of hepatocytes, which are the primary cell type responsible for various metabolic and detoxification processes. Hepatocytes are specialized cells that possess a unique morphology, with features such as a large nucleus surrounded by cytoplasmic domains of varying densities. The cellular organization within liver parenchyma is characterized by a hexagonal arrangement of hepatocytes, which allows for efficient exchange of metabolites with adjacent cells and the sinusoidal blood supply. The liver parenchyma plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. Hepatocytes are capable of converting nutrients from food into energy-rich molecules, while also processing drugs and eliminating toxins. The parenchymal structure also enables the liver to regulate blood glucose levels through glycogen storage and release. The lobules, which are clusters of hepatocytes separated by portal tracts, serve as the functional building blocks of the liver. Each lobule contains a central vein, which collects blood from surrounding hepatocytes, and terminal hepatic veins that return oxygenated blood to the heart. The unique arrangement of blood vessels within each lobule allows for efficient exchange of metabolites between cells and the sinusoidal blood. The organization and functioning of liver parenchyma are maintained by the balance of various signaling pathways, including those involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Disruptions in these pathways can lead to liver disease, such as cirrhosis or cancer, which highlights the importance of understanding the intricacies of liver parenchymal function. In summary, the liver parenchyma is a complex tissue composed of hepatocytes that work together to perform critical functions essential for overall health. Its unique structure and"
UBERON_0001281,"Hepatic sinusoids, also referred to as liver hepatic sinusoids, liver sinusoid, liver sinusoidal blood vessel, sinusoid of liver, sinusoidal blood vessel of liver, vas capillare sinusoideum, and vas sinusoideum, are a type of narrow-walled blood vessel found in the liver. These structures play a crucial role in facilitating exchange processes between the bloodstream and hepatocytes, the main cell type of the liver. Hepatic sinusoids are characterized by their unique architecture, which lacks the typical markers of veins (such as endothelial cells with fenestrations) or arteries (like smooth muscle cells). Instead, these vessels have a thin wall composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, which is perforated by numerous small pores called slit diaphragms. These pores allow for the free movement of molecules between the blood and hepatocytes. The lumen of the hepatic sinusoid is lined with a layer of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which are specialized endothelial cells that have lost their typical fenestrations and are characterized by numerous protrusions called podosomes. LSECs produce various growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that modulate the immune response and influence hepatocyte function. Hepatic sinusoids are also connected to a network of small channels and canals, known as central veins or terminal hepatic venule, which drain into the larger hepatic veins. The blood flow through these vessels is bidirectional, allowing for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the liver and the bloodstream. The unique structure and function of hepatic sinusoids enable the liver to perform its complex metabolic functions, such as detoxification, metabolism of drugs, and biosynthesis of lipids. In summary, hepatic sinusoids are narrow-walled blood vessels that play a vital role in facilitating exchange processes between the"
UBERON_0001282,"The intralobular bile duct, also known as the canal of Herring or cholangiole, is a small, tubular structure located within the liver lobule. It is situated between the bile canaliculi and interlobular bile ducts near the outer edge of the lobule. The intralobular bile duct arises from the junction of the terminal hepatic veins with the portal vein, which is located at the boundary of each liver lobule. These ducts collect bile from the hepatocytes in the central zone of the lobule and transport it towards the interlobular bile duct, ultimately connecting to the left and right hepatic ducts. The intralobular bile ducts are relatively short, typically measuring 0.5-1.5 mm in length, and have a diameter of approximately 50-100 μm. They possess a muscular layer and a lumen that is lined by simple columnar epithelial cells. The luminal surface of the cholangiole is adorned with small projections called microvilli. The intralobular bile ducts play a crucial role in maintaining liver function, as they facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the hepatocytes and the bloodstream. They also serve to regulate bile flow, allowing for optimal levels of bile salts to be delivered to the intestine for fat digestion and absorption. In certain pathological conditions, the intralobular bile ducts can become obstructed due to inflammation, fibrosis, or scarring. This can lead to a reduction in liver function and contribute to the development of cirrhosis. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the intralobular bile duct is essential for diagnosing and managing liver diseases."
UBERON_0002107,"The liver is an exocrine gland that plays a vital role in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and fat, as well as synthesizing substances involved in blood coagulation and vitamin A production. Its primary functions include secreting bile into the bile ducts to aid in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins. The liver is also responsible for detoxifying poisonous substances by removing toxins from the bloodstream through processes such as hepatic conjugation, where toxic compounds are converted into water-soluble metabolites that can be excreted. Furthermore, the liver stores glycogen, a complex carbohydrate that serves as a readily mobilizable energy source. In addition to its metabolic functions, the liver plays a critical role in blood clotting by synthesizing several key proteins involved in coagulation, including prothrombin and fibrinogen. The liver is also responsible for synthesizing vitamin A from beta-carotene through a series of complex biochemical reactions. One of the liver's most important roles is to break down worn-out erythrocytes, or red blood cells, into their constituent parts through a process called hemolysis. This process involves the degradation of hemoglobin and other cellular components by various enzymes and proteases. The liver also plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating electrolyte levels, pH balance, and the body's response to infection and inflammation. Its diverse range of functions make it an essential organ for overall health and survival. The term ""liver"" is often used interchangeably with other terms, such as hepatocyte or liver cell, although these terms specifically refer to the functional units within the liver that perform various metabolic and synthetic functions. The liver's complex structure and multifaceted roles highlight its importance as a vital organ in maintaining human health."
UBERON_0004058,"A biliary ductule, also referred to as a bile ductule or ductuli biliferi, is a fine terminal element of the bile duct system that originates from the portal canal and courses along the periphery of a liver lobule. These small ductules are part of the overall excretory apparatus of the liver, responsible for transporting bile into the bloodstream. Biliary ductules arise from the terminal ends of interlobular ductules, which themselves branch off from larger hepatic ducts. The right and left hepatic ducts converge to form a common hepatic duct, and then merge with other structures to form the common bile duct, ultimately emptying into the second part of the duodenum. Each biliary ductule consists of an epithelial-lined lumen surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle, allowing for regulated contraction and relaxation. This muscular control enables the ductules to actively transport bile from the liver into the interlobular spaces, where it can be absorbed and utilized by other tissues. In terms of anatomy, biliary ductules are generally smaller than 2 millimeters in diameter and exhibit a characteristic ""Y"" or ""T"" branching pattern. This unique morphology facilitates their integration with adjacent hepatic tissue, allowing for efficient distribution of bile throughout the liver. During normal physiology, the flow of bile through the biliary ductule is regulated by the interplay of muscular contractions and relaxations. In some cases, ductular obstruction may occur due to injury or disease, leading to conditions such as cholestasis. In these instances, the normal flow of bile may be impaired, resulting in elevated liver enzymes and other clinical manifestations. Understanding the structure and function of biliary ductules is essential for comprehending the complex physiology of the liver, particularly with regards to its role in detoxification and nutrient metabolism. By elucidating the detailed anatomy and regulated transport mechanisms governing these small ductules"
UBERON_0004647,"A hepatic lobule, also known as a liver lobule, hepatocyte radiating structure, or lobulus hepaticus, is the functional unit of the liver that consists of hepatocytes arranged in a polygonal pattern around central hepatic veins. The lobules are surrounded by a fibrous connective tissue capsule and are separated from one another by fibrous septa. Each lobule is typically 2-3 mm in diameter and contains approximately 200,000 to 250,000 hepatocytes, which are responsible for the liver's metabolic functions. The radiating structure of the hepatocytes, with their central sinusoids, allows for efficient exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood supply and the cells. The lobules are arranged in a modular pattern within the liver, with each module (or acinus) consisting of multiple adjacent lobules. This organization enables the liver to perform a wide range of metabolic functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of bile. The structural organization of the hepatic lobule is supported by a network of blood vessels, which include central veins, portal trunks, and sinusoids. The central veins drain blood away from the liver, while the portal trunks bring nutrient-rich blood to the liver for processing. The sinusoids, which are narrow channels lined with endothelial cells, facilitate the exchange of substances between the hepatocytes and the bloodstream. In summary, the hepatic lobule is a fundamental unit of liver structure that consists of hepatocytes arranged in a polygonal pattern around central veins. Its modular organization enables efficient exchange of metabolites and nutrients, making it an essential component of the liver's metabolic functions."
UBERON_0005452,"The hepatic cord, also known as lamina hepatica, liver cell plate, or hepatic laminae, is a three-dimensional arrangement of hepatocytes that radiates from the center of the liver lobule. Characterized by highly branched and irregular structures, these plates are typically one cell thick and serve as a scaffold for the organization of liver tissue. The hepatic cord is bounded by endothelial-lined vascular spaces called hepatic sinusoids, which facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. The intricate network of hepatic cords and sinusoids enables the liver to perform its critical functions, including detoxification, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The arrangement of hepatocytes within the hepatic cord is such that each cell is in close contact with its neighbors, forming a tight cluster known as a bile canalicular junction. This unique structure allows for efficient transport of bile salts from the hepatocytes into the sinusoids, where they can be secreted into the bile ducts. The branching patterns of the hepatic cords vary depending on the location within the liver lobule, with some cords being more linear and others exhibiting a more irregular morphology. This variability is thought to reflect the complex interactions between hepatocytes and other cells in the liver tissue, including Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and stellate cells. In summary, the hepatic cord is a key structural element of the liver lobule, providing a framework for the organization of hepatocytes and facilitating the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and signaling molecules between the liver parenchyma and the bloodstream. Its unique arrangement and branching patterns reflect the intricate relationships within the liver tissue, making it an essential component of liver function and overall physiology."
UBERON_0006588,"The ligamentum teres hepatis, also known as the round ligament of the liver, is a fibrous remnant that exists along the free edge of the falciform ligament in the liver. This anatomical structure serves as a boundary between the left medial and lateral segments of the liver. Developmentally, the ligamentum teres hepatis represents the persistent remnant of the fetal left umbilical vein. In utero, this umbilical vein is patent and plays a crucial role in fetal circulation. After birth, the vein gradually degenerates into fibrous tissue, forming the ligamentum teres hepatis. Notably, the ligamentum teres hepatis only exists in mammals, as it is associated with the development of the umbilicus. This unique characteristic distinguishes it from other remnants of fetal structures that may persist in non-mammalian species. Anatomically, the round ligament inserts around the umbilicus and serves as a landmark on the inner surface of the anterior abdominal wall. Its presence can be felt during palpation, typically located about 1-2 cm lateral to the umbilical cord insertion. The ligamentum teres hepatis is an important structure in liver anatomy, particularly for surgeons and radiologists. During laparoscopic procedures or imaging studies, the round ligament may be encountered and recognized as a potential source of bleeding or injury. Clinical significance of the ligamentum teres hepatis includes its association with liver disease and abdominal wall hernias. In some cases, the ligament may become entangled in other structures, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort. In summary, the ligamentum teres hepatis is a fibrous remnant that represents the persistent remnant of the fetal left umbilical vein, unique to mammals and playing an important role in liver anatomy."
UBERON_0006727,"The liver left lateral lobe, also referred to as the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver, lateral segment of the liver, or segmentum laterale (lobus hepatis sinister), is a functional unit of the liver that plays a crucial role in its overall anatomy and physiology. This segment is one of the eight segments into which the liver is divided based on the branching pattern of the portal veins and the hepatic artery. The left lateral lobe is situated on the right side of the midline of the liver and covers approximately 60-70% of the liver's surface area. It is bounded by the inferior vena cava to the left, the gallbladder bed to the right, and the falciform ligament to the anterior aspect. The segment is further subdivided into four subsegments (II, III, IVa, and IVb) based on the branching pattern of the portal vein. The liver left lateral lobe is primarily responsible for detoxification processes, such as conjugating bilirubin and removing waste products from the bloodstream. It also plays a significant role in protein metabolism and lipogenesis. The segment contains approximately 10-15% of the liver's total mass and accounts for about 60-70% of its total blood flow. The left lateral lobe receives blood supply from both the right and left hepatic arteries via the right and left branches of the hepatic artery, respectively. The portal vein also supplies this segment, with the left branch of the portal vein being particularly relevant. The segment drains into the middle hepatic vein, which then empties into the inferior vena cava. Anatomical variations in the segmentation of the liver are not uncommon and can be attributed to individual differences in liver morphology or due to surgical interventions. This understanding is essential for surgeons and radiologists to accurately identify and resect the left lateral lobe during"
UBERON_0006728,"The medial segment of the liver, also known as the segmentum mediale (lobus hepatis sinister) or liver left medial lobe, is one of the eight hepatic segments defined by the Couinaud classification system. This segment corresponds to the area of the left liver lobe that lies anteriorly to the falciform ligament and posteriorly to the left portal vein. The medial segment is separated from its contralateral counterpart by the left portal vein, which also demarcates its boundary with the caudate lobe. The segment's superior border is defined by the inferior margin of the diaphragm, while its inferior border lies approximately 2 cm proximal to the umbilicus. The medial segment receives its blood supply from the left branch of the portal vein and the left hepatic artery, which supplies it with oxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract. The right branch of the portal vein supplies adjacent segments, including the lateral segment of the left lobe (segment IV), while the middle hepatic artery supplies segments II and III. The medial segment is primarily involved in detoxification, metabolism, and storage processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and supporting various bodily functions. The presence of centrilobular cells within this segment facilitates the metabolism of bile acids, xenobiotics, and other substrates that undergo hepatic processing. Anatomical variations may occur due to individual differences in liver morphology or anatomical rearrangements during fetal development. These variations can impact surgical approaches and port-site anatomy in laparoscopic interventions involving the medial segment. Clinical significance of the medial segment is primarily related to its involvement in portal hypertension, which may necessitate therapeutic interventions such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures or selective internal jugular vein portacaval shunts. In these contexts, preserving liver function and maintaining adequate"
UBERON_0006729,"The liver perisinusoidal space, also known as Disse's space, hepatic perisinusoidal space, perisinusoidal space of Disse, space of Disse, and spatium perisinusoideum, is a distinct extracellular compartment situated between the sinusoidal endothelial cells and the hepatocytes in the liver. This space is characterized by its unique ultrastructural features, including a continuous layer of fenestrated capillary endothelium and a single layer of bile canalicular cells. The Disse's space plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of liver function by facilitating the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and signaling molecules between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. This compartment is lined by a specialized membrane that regulates the passage of solutes, ions, and macromolecules through specific transport mechanisms. The Disse's space also serves as a reservoir for various proteins, including albumin, which helps to maintain blood volume and prevent edema. Additionally, this compartment provides a site for storage and release of vasoactive substances, such as nitric oxide and endothelin-1, which regulate liver blood flow and sinusoidal permeability. The Disse's space is distinct from the classical extracellular space in several ways. Its unique morphology and function allow it to accommodate specific molecules that are not readily exchanged across the more traditional cellular membranes. For example, albumin is retained within the Disse's space due to its binding affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the sinusoidal endothelial cells. The study of the Disse's space has provided valuable insights into liver function and disease. Abnormalities in this compartment have been implicated in various liver disorders, including steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Understanding the intricate relationships between the Disse's space and hepatocyte function is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to target these diseases. In conclusion,"
UBERON_0006841,"The central vein of the liver, also known as the terminal branch of hepatic vein or terminal hepatic venule, is a key structural element within the hepatic lobule. This vessel serves as the central collector of blood draining from the sinusoidal capillaries that surround the hepatocytes. The central vein receives deoxygenated blood from both the portal and systemic circulation, which are then merged into a single stream prior to its excretion. Anatomically, the central vein is situated in the center of each hepatic lobule, separating it from adjacent lobules. It extends upwards towards the central vein of the liver, which ultimately connects to the inferior vena cava via the hepatic veins. The terminal branch of the hepatic vein merges with its fellow branches to form the main hepatic vein. The central vein plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow within the liver and maintaining homeostasis. Its diameter and blood pressure can influence the rate of hepatocyte oxygenation and nutrient delivery, which are critical for normal liver function. Alterations in central vein diameter or tone can disrupt this delicate balance, leading to impaired hepatocyte metabolism. In terms of histology, the central vein is a large, thin-walled vessel composed primarily of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It lacks the characteristic fenestrated endothelium seen in sinusoidal capillaries, which limits its permeability. Despite this, the central vein remains an essential component of the liver's vascular network. The concept of the central vein of the liver is also relevant to understanding liver disease pathophysiology. For example, changes in central vein diameter or tone can contribute to elevated portal pressure and subsequent fibrosis or cirrhosis. Additionally, alterations in central vein blood flow have been linked to conditions such as Budd-Chiari syndrome. In summary, the central vein of the liver is a critical component of the hepatic lobule"
UBERON_0011955,"The left hepatic vein is a major venous structure that plays a crucial role in the drainage of blood from the liver. It is one of the three main hepatic veins, which are responsible for emptying the liver's sinusoids and transporting blood to the inferior vena cava. The left hepatic vein is specifically associated with the left lobe of the liver. Anatomically, the left hepatic vein arises from the confluence of the left branch of the portal vein and the left branch of the hepatic artery proper, which supplies oxygenated blood to the liver. It then courses inferiorly along the right edge of the left medial segment of the liver and passes posterior to the inferior vena cava. As it progresses, the left hepatic vein receives tributaries from various segments of the liver, including the left lateral section. The left hepatic vein eventually joins with the right hepatic vein at the porta hepatis, forming the superior mesenteric vein-portal vein junction. This confluence is an important anatomical landmark in abdominal surgery and interventional radiology. The combined flow from both hepatic veins enters the inferior vena cava, where it ultimately returns to the heart. The left hepatic vein's role in liver physiology is multifaceted. Its drainage of blood from the sinusoids helps to regulate liver function and metabolism, including protein synthesis and detoxification processes. Abnormalities in the left hepatic vein or its tributaries can lead to portal hypertension, a condition characterized by elevated pressure within the portal venous system.

This alias highlights the vein's function in receiving blood from both the arterial and portal systems. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the left hepatic vein is essential for diagnosing and"
UBERON_0011956,"The right hepatic vein is one of three main hepatic veins that drain blood from the liver, forming part of the portal venous system. This particular vein is associated with the right lobe of the liver, which constitutes approximately half of the total liver volume. Anatomically, the right hepatic vein originates from the confluence of the hepatic veins and drains blood from the right lobe of the liver into the inferior vena cava at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebra. It is also referred to as the ""posterior cardinal vein"" due to its origin from the posterior cardinal veins. The right hepatic vein receives blood from both the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic arteries, with a proportionate contribution from each. The venous blood is enriched with oxygenated blood from the digestive organs and nutrients absorbed by the gut during digestion. Blood flow through the right hepatic vein is subject to various regulatory mechanisms to ensure optimal liver function, including autoregulation of blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system stimulation. In addition, the right hepatic vein plays a crucial role in maintaining bile production and secretion, which are essential for lipid metabolism and nutrient digestion. Dysfunction or thrombosis of the right hepatic vein can lead to portal hypertension, characterized by increased intrahepatic resistance and elevated blood pressure within the liver. This condition is often associated with cirrhosis, scarring of the liver due to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Clinical manifestations of right hepatic vein thrombosis or other pathologies affecting this vein may include ascites, splenomegaly, and signs of portal hypertension such as varices and esophageal varices. Furthermore, complications arising from right hepatic vein obstruction can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a neurological disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and altered mental status. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the right hepatic"
UBERON_0011957,"The middle hepatic vein is a tributary of the inferior vena cava that plays a crucial role in the drainage of blood from the liver. Also known as the left hepatic vein, it is one of two major hepatic veins that drain the right lobe of the liver. Located on the anterior surface of the liver, the middle hepatic vein is situated between the caudate and right posterior sectors of the liver. It arises from the junction of the right and left portal veins and receives blood from various hepatic branches, including the right branch of the portal vein and the left branch of the hepatic artery. The middle hepatic vein ascends anteriorly along the inferior edge of the diaphragm and becomes closely related to the inferior vena cava. As it approaches the junction with the inferior vena cava, it undergoes significant compression by the pericardial fat pad, leading to a marked narrowing of its lumen. The middle hepatic vein drains blood from the right half of the liver into the inferior vena cava at the hepatic veins' confluence. This confluence marks an important anatomical landmark in the region and is typically located near the origin of the right branch of the portal vein. Anatomically, the middle hepatic vein is closely related to various structures in the abdominal cavity, including the stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and small intestine. Its proximity to these organs makes it susceptible to compression by adjacent structures during laparoscopic or open surgical procedures. The clinical significance of the middle hepatic vein lies in its role as a key drainage pathway for blood from the liver. Conditions such as portal hypertension, which leads to increased pressure within the portal vein system, can result in dilation and stenosis of the middle hepatic vein, leading to significant morbidity and mortality."
UBERON_0013138,"The coronary ligament, also known as the ligamentum coronarium hepatis, is a fibrous structure that connects the liver to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. It is one of the peritoneal reflections that form a series of folds and attachments between the liver and adjacent organs. Anatomically, the coronary ligament arises from the posterior surfaces of the left and right hemidiaphragms and extends downward to attach to the inferior border of the liver, near the gallbladder fossa.

UBERON_0015482,"The right hepatic artery, also known as the ramus dexter (arteria hepatica propria) or the right branch of hepatic artery proper, is a vital arterial supply to the liver that arises from the common hepatic artery. It originates from the first part of the common hepatic artery, which is formed by the union of the gastroduodenal and splenic arteries. The right hepatic artery then ascends along the right border of the liver, traversing through the free edge of the lesser omentum to reach its terminal destination at the porta hepatis. Here, it anastomoses with the left hepatic artery, forming a continuous arterial supply to the liver. As it courses through the liver, the right hepatic artery supplies blood to various segments and lobes of the liver, including the right lobe and portions of the caudate lobe. It also gives off several smaller branches, such as the proper hepatic ducts and the cystic duct. Anatomically, the right hepatic artery is distinct from its left counterpart, with differences in origin, course, and distribution within the liver. The right hepatic artery is typically larger than the left hepatic artery due to its longer course through the liver, which allows it to supply a greater surface area of the liver. The ramus dexter (arteria hepatica propria) plays a crucial role in maintaining the liver's blood supply and overall function. Disruption or damage to this arterial branch can lead to ischemic injury to the liver, resulting in hepatocellular necrosis and potentially severe consequences for patients with underlying liver disease.

Accurate localization and preservation of this arterial branch are critical for minimizing morbidity and mortality associated with liver surgery."
UBERON_0015796,"The liver blood vessel is a dual-branching vascular structure that supplies oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to the liver, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the hepatic tissue and the circulatory system. Also known as the hepatic artery and portal vein, this unique blood vessel system plays a crucial role in maintaining liver function and overall physiological homeostasis. The hepatic artery arises from the celiac trunk and supplies oxygenated blood to the liver, while the portal vein originates from the splenic vein and drains deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract. The hepatic artery is a smaller diameter vessel that branches into several terminal arteries, which anastomose with each other to form a network of collateral vessels. These terminal arteries supply oxygenated blood to the liver's sinusoidal region, where exchange of nutrients and waste products occurs between hepatocytes and the circulatory system. In contrast, the portal vein is a larger diameter vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and pancreas to the liver. This blood is rich in nutrients and waste products absorbed from the gut, which are then processed by the liver's sinusoidal region. The interaction between the hepatic artery and portal vein enables the liver to perform its critical functions of detoxification, protein synthesis, and lipid metabolism. The unique anatomy and physiology of this dual-branching vessel system allow for efficient exchange of nutrients and waste products, ensuring optimal liver function and overall health. Dysregulation of the liver blood vessel system has been implicated in various hepatic disorders, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and metabolic syndrome. Understanding the complex relationships between the hepatic artery and portal vein is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving liver function and preventing disease progression."

This unique structure plays a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis and modulating the exchange of substances between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. The liver stroma consists of a network of fibrous cells, including hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), pericytes, and endothelial progenitor cells, which are embedded within a rich supply of blood vessels, lymphatics, and sinusoidal channels. The stromal tissue is characterized by its high density of collagen fibrils, reticular fibers, and extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin and fibronectin. The liver stroma is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved structure that has developed to facilitate the specialized functions of the liver, including detoxification, metabolism, and immunological regulation. The stromal tissue serves as a reservoir for bile acid storage, vitamin D metabolism, and lipid synthesis, among other functions. One of the key characteristics of the liver stroma is its ability to regulate the production of extracellular matrix proteins in response to liver injury or inflammation. Upon activation, HSCs undergo a phenotypic transformation into myofibroblast-like cells, which produce excessive amounts of collagen and other ECM components, leading to fibrogenesis. The liver stroma also plays a critical role in maintaining liver function during development, injury, and disease. It provides structural support for the hepatocyte population and regulates the exchange of substances between hepatocytes and the bloodstream. Furthermore, the stromal tissue is involved in the regulation of immune responses, including the production of cytokines and chemokines that modulate inflammation. In summary, the liver stroma is a complex tissue compartment that plays a vital role in maintaining liver homeostasis and regulating various physiological and"
