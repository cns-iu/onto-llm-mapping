UBERON_0001113,"lobe of liveralso known as hepatic lobe; liver lobe; lobus hepatis Traditional gross anatomy divided the liver into four lobes based on surface features. The falciform ligament is visible on the front (anterior side) of the liver. This divides the liver into a left anatomical lobe, and a right anatomical lobe."
UBERON_0001114,"right lobe of liveralso known as liver right lobe; lobus hepaticus dexter; right liver lobe The right lobe is much larger than the left; the proportion between them being as six to one. It occupies the right hypochondrium, and is separated from the left lobe on its upper surface by the falciform ligament; on its under and posterior surfaces by the left sagittal fossa; and in front by the umbilical notch. It is of a somewhat quadrilateral form, its under and posterior surfaces being marked by three fossæ: the porta and the fossæ for the gall-bladder and inferior vena cava, which separate its left part into two smaller lobes; the quadrate and caudate lobes. [WP,unvetted]."
UBERON_0001115,"left lobe of liveralso known as left liver lobe; liver left lobe; lobus hepaticus sinister The left lobe is smaller and more flattened than the right. It is situated in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Its upper surface is slightly convex and is moulded on to the diaphragm; its under surface presents the gastric impression and omental tuberosity. [WP,unvetted]."
UBERON_0001116,"quadrate lobe of liveralso known as liver quadrate lobe; lobus quadratus; lobus quadratus hepatis The quadrate lobe is an area of the liver situated on the under surface of the right lobe, bounded in front by the anterior margin of the liver; behind by the porta hepatis; on the right, by the fossa for the gall-bladder; and on the left, by the fossa for the umbilical vein. It is oblong in shape, its antero-posterior diameter being greater than its transverse. [WP,unvetted]."
UBERON_0001117,"caudate lobe of liveralso known as couinaud hepatic segment I; hepatovenous segment I; liver caudate lobe; lobus caudatus; lobus caudatus hepatis; pars posterior hepatis; posterior hepatic segment i; posterior liver; posterior part of liver; segment I of liver; segmentum hepatis I; Spiegelian lobe; Spigel lobe The caudate lobe (posterior hepatic segment I, Spigelian lobe) is situated upon the postero-superior surface of the liver on the right lobe of the liver, opposite the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae. It is bounded on the left side by the physiological division of the liver called the ligamentum venosum. It is bounded, below, by the porta; on the right, by the fossa for the inferior vena cava; and, on the left, by the fossa for the ductus venosus. It looks backward, being nearly vertical in position; it is longer from above downward than from side to side, and is somewhat concave in the transverse direction. The caudate process is a small elevation of the hepatic substance extending obliquely and laterally, from the lower extremity of the caudate lobe to the under surface of the right lobe. It is situated behind the porta, and separates the fossa for the gall-bladder from the commencement of the fossa for the inferior vena cava. Budd-Chiari syndrome, caused by occlusion of hepatic venous outflow, can lead to hypertrophy of the caudate lobe due to its own caval anastomosis that allows for continued function of this lobe of the liver. [WP,unvetted]."

UBERON_0001247,"falciform ligamentalso known as falciform ligament of liver; ligamentum falciforme (hepatis); ligamentum falciforme hepatis A ligament that attaches the liver to the anterior body wall. It is a broad and thin antero-posterior peritoneal fold, falciform in shape, its base being directed downward and backward and its apex upward and backward. It is a remnant of the ventral mesentery of the fetus. It is situated in an antero-posterior plane but lies obliquely, so that one surface faces forward and is in contact with the peritoneum behind the right rectus and the diaphragm, while the other is directed backward and is in contact with the left lobe of the liver. It is attached by its left margin to the under surface of the diaphragm and the posterior surface of the sheath of the right Rectus as low down as the umbilicus; by its right margin it extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as the posterior surface. It is composed of two layers of peritoneum closely united together. Its base or free edge contains between its layers the round ligament and the paraumbilical veins[WP]."
UBERON_0001279,"portal triadalso known as trias hepatica A multi-organ-part structure that consists of three vessels of the portal lobule including the bile duct, a terminal branch of the hepatic artery and portal vein, and may also include a lymphatic vessel."

In mammals they have neither veinous or arterial markers.

UBERON_0002107,"liver An exocrine gland which secretes bile and functions in metabolism of protein and carbohydrate and fat, synthesizes substances involved in the clotting of the blood, synthesizes vitamin A, detoxifies poisonous substances, stores glycogen, and breaks down worn-out erythrocytes[GO]."
UBERON_0004058,"biliary ductulealso known as bile ductule; biliary ductule; ductuli biliferi One of the fine terminal elements of the bile duct system, leaving the portal canal, and pursuing a course at the periphery of a lobule of the liver[BTO]. the excretory ducts of the liver that connect the interlobular ductules to the right or left hepatic duct[MP]."

UBERON_0005452,"hepatic cordalso known as hepatic lamina; lamina hepatica; liver cell plate; hepatic laminae A three-dimensional arrangement formed by plates of hepatocytes, usually one cell thick, that radiates from the center of the liver lobule; hepatic laminae are highly branched, irregular structures bordered by endothelial lined vascular spaces called hepatic sinusoids."
UBERON_0006588,"round ligament of liveralso known as ligamentum teres hepatis; ligamentum teres hepatitis; ligamentum teres of liver A degenerative string of tissue that exists in the free edge of the falciform ligament of the liver. Anatomically, the round ligament divides the left part of the liver into medial and lateral sections. The round ligament represents the remnant of the fetal left umbilical vein. The round ligament therefore only exists in mammals. Prenatally and for a month or two after birth, the left umbilical vein is patent, subsequently degenerating to fibrous tissue, the round ligament. The umbilical vein/round ligament inserts around the umbilicus and is an important landmark of the inner surface of the anterior abdominal wall[WP]."
