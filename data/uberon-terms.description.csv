UBERON_0004616,"mammalian cervical vertebra 7also known as C7 vertebra; cervical vertebra 7; prominent vertebra; seventh cervical vertebra; vertebra prominens (CVII); vertebra prominens [C VII] Vertebra prominens is the proper name for the seventh cervical vertebra. The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process which is palpable from the skin surface, hence the name. This spinous process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, but terminating in a tubercle to which the lower end of the ligamentum nuchae is attached. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) has the most prominent spinous process only in about 70% of people; in the remainder, either C6 or T1 (the first thoracic vertebra) will be the most prominent. The transverse processes are of considerable size, their posterior roots are large and prominent, while the anterior are small and faintly marked; the upper surface of each has usually a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation. The foramen transversarium may be as large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but is generally smaller on one or both sides; occasionally it is double, sometimes it is absent. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides; but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, and not through the foramen. Sometimes the anterior root of the transverse process attains a large size and exists as a separate bone, which is known as a cervical rib."

Chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (the seventh cranial nerve) that serves the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. The chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves. The chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves."

UBERON_0012255,"inferior phrenic arteryalso known as arteriae phrenicae inferiores The inferior phrenic arteries are two small vessels, which supply the diaphragm but present much variety in their origin. They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately above the celiac artery, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta or from the celiac artery. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries; they rarely arise as separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the diaphragm, and then run obliquely upward and lateralward upon its under surface. The left phrenic passes behind the esophagus, and runs forward on the left side of the esophageal hiatus. The right phrenic passes behind the inferior vena cava, and along the right side of the foramen which transmits that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon each vessel divides into a medial and a lateral branch. The medial branch curves forward, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries. The lateral branch passes toward the side of the thorax, and anastomoses with the lower intercostal arteries, and with the musculophrenic. The lateral branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one, some branches to the esophagus. Each vessel gives off superior suprarenal branches to the suprarenal gland of its own side. The spleen and the liver also receive a few twigs from the left and right vessels respectively."

UBERON_8600022,"pulmonary interlobular septum A septum that surrounds and gives shape to the secondary pulmonary lobules, it is composed of connective tissue within which run the pulmonary veins and lymphatic vessels."
UBERON_8600026,chorionic villous treealso known as placental villous tree A tree-like structure formed by chorionic villi that sprouts from the chorionic plate in the placental disc. The arborous shape of the chorionic villous tree provides maximal contact area with maternal blood in the intervillous space.
UBERON_8600027,"chorionic stem villusalso known as placental stem villus A chorionic villus that provides structural support to the villous tree. A chorionic stem villus is characterized by a condensed fibrous stroma in which fetal arteries, veins, arterioles, and venules are embedded. It represents a distributing framework for fetal chorionic circulation, supplying the floating villi. It can exhibit a diameter ranging from approximately 3000 μm (trunci near the chorionic plate) to 80 μm (smallest ramuli chorii)."
UBERON_8600028,"chorionic mesenchymal villus The first generation of a tertiary villus that is derived from a syncytial sprout by the invasion of the mesenchyme, in which blood vessels differentiate through vasculogenesis, and gradually transforms into a new immature intermediate villus. A chorionic mesenchymal villus has a thick trophoblastic covering, and cytotrophoblast cells are interposed between syncytium and the trophoblastic basal lamina over 50–100% of the surface. The stroma is characterized by loosely arranged collagen fibers that enmesh mesenchymal and some villous macrophages. The fetal capillaries are poorly developed."
UBERON_8600029,"chorionic immature intermediate villus A bulbous, immature chorionic villus that is formed of loose connective tissue with few fetal vessels. A chorionic immature intermediate villus develops from a chorionic mesenchymal villus, and is the forerunner of a chorionic stem villus."
UBERON_8600030,"chorionic terminal villus The most distal part of a chorionic villus. A chorionic terminal villus is a grape-like structure characterized by a high degree of capillarization and highly dilated sinusoids. A terminal villus has less stroma and a discontinuous cytotrophoblast layer, and contains 4–6 fetal capillaries per cross section. It exhibits a diameter ranging from 40 to about 80 μm."
UBERON_8600031,"chorionic mature intermediate villus A slender branch of a chorionic stem villus. A chorionic mature intermediate villus lacks fetal arterioles and venules in the stroma, which is composed of slender fetal capillaries embedded into a loose connective tissue that is rich in cells but poor in fibers. It exhibits a diameter ranging from 60 to about 100 μm."
UBERON_8600032,chorionic floating villus A chorionic villus that is not attached to the placental basal plate and it is immersed in maternal blood.
UBERON_8600036,kidney loop of Henle long descending thin limb outer medullaalso known as long descending limb of the loop of Henle in the outer medulla A section of the long descending thin limb of the loop of Henle that is part of the outer medulla of the kidney.
UBERON_8600037,kidney loop of Henle long descending thin limb inner medullaalso known as long descending limb of the loop of Henle in the inner medulla A section of the long descending thin limb of the loop of Henle that is part of the inner medulla of the kidney.
UBERON_8600038,"placental discalso known as placental disk A disc-shaped structure that is part of the placenta. A placental disc supports fetal development through the exchange of nutrients between maternal and fetal bloodstreams. The placental disc is structured to keep the blood streams separate, while maximizing surface area for the transport of nutrients between them, to maintain an immunological barrier."
UBERON_8600039,chorionic villous mesenchyme A mesenchyme that is part of a chorionic villus.
UBERON_8600040,chorionic stem villous blood vessel A blood vessel that is part of a chorionic stem villus.
UBERON_8600041,"chorionic terminal villous capillary A capillary that is part of a chorionic terminal villus. This capillary is generally narrow, but displays sinusoidal dilations along its length, often at the points of acute bends. These dilations bring the capillary endothelium into close contact with the overlying syncytiotrophoblast to form a vasculosyncytial membrane."
UBERON_8600042,endometrial lymphatic vessel A lymphatic vessel that is part of an endometrium.
